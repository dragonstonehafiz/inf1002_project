Obligatorio si eres fan de la saga,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Si te manejas con el inglés y te gusta el lore de Destiny es una compra obligatoria. El libro parece muchísimo más caro que lo que cuesta, con la portada de piel acolchada y las páginas satinadas de buen gramaje. Incluye ilustraciones y extractos de la historia de Destiny con detalles que aportan profundidad a eventos que están pasando ahora mismo en el juego (en este volumen se nombran detalles sobre la oscuridad y que habrá guardianes que puedan darle uso, etc.). Si solo te gusta el juego por los tiros, igual te parece una tontería, pero si te interesa la historia y todo el background que construye el universo Destiny es una compra obligatoria. Ideal para entender un poco mejor los videos de ""My name is Byf""."
Beautiful and hard covered,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, I was really impressed with the quality for the price. It is a gorgeous hard cover book and it’s really thick and large. I was also shocked by the quality of the images. I will be buying more for my boyfriend soon!"
Great Read,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a great read for a fan of the series.
La copertina di pelle è qualcosa di incredibile!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"La copertina rende questo libro così magnifico, gli da un'idea di libro prezioso e pezzo da collezione. All'interno ci sono molte storie e dialoghi tratti dal gioco. Regalato a mio fratello che gioca principalmente a Destiny, lo ha adorato :)"
MANCA L'EMBLEMA,3.0 out of 5 stars,Il libro è bellissimo! peccato che non sia arrivato nessun codice per riscattare l'emblema
10/10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"La tapa es de cuero falso y definitivamente se siente de calidad. Fue un regalo para mi chico y quedó encantado, además incluye un código que puedes canjear en tu usuario de Destiny 2 por un emblema. Excelente para coleccionar."
"If you love Destiny and it’s lore, then you’ll love this product",5.0 out of 5 stars,Product arrived in great condition. A good purchase for any Destiny fans interested in the story that drives the game.
Very Interesting,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love the Kings Fall raid, you'll enjoy this book. It's mainly about the hive and how they came to be."
Every Destiny fan should have,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful illustrations and so classic looking.  My fiance loves the contents, as he loves the lore of Destiny.  I'm not a gamer but I love books and even I'm proud to show this one off in our collection"
It's basically a printed version of Book of Sorrows with minimal illustrations,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I compare ""game"" printed lorebooks to the following standards: Does it stand up as something separate from the game (good writing, illustrations)? Does it feel like a piece of the game made material? Is it well made?One of my favorite books as a kid was some lore book from a fantasy gaming book series, and I had no idea till decades later when I stumbled across the book series in a library give-away bin. More recent game-lore books I've loved are ""Book of Cain"" (Diablo 3) and ""New York Survival Guide"" (The Division).The easy route is to take in-game lore and just dump it in a printed book. The better approach is to recontextualize the story, setting and lore into something new and complementary.I was SUPER excited to see Destiny lore books! Unfortunately, Bungie took the aforementioned easy route with Vol.1.Vol.1 disappoints. Its just the Book of Sorrow on printed page with a few extra illustrations. Don't get me wrong! I and many fans agree Book of Sorrow is the best ""Lore"" from Destiny 1's Grimoire page, but the fact that this is just the ""book"" on paper with a few sparse illustrations is a bummer.Vol.2 is a vast improvement, and I feel like you need the ""full collection"" if you're into Destiny lore in any way. Physically, the book is very well made with nice feeling paper, a sturdy spine, and a nice faux-leather pluffy cover. The few illustrations that are there are very well done. It'll look ""classy"" (or as classy as a piece of game merchandise can look) on a shelf.Just be aware what you're getting if you're a long-time fan. There's not alot new here."
Loved it,5.0 out of 5 stars,The cover felt nice and the pages design looked great. The art was really good too. Definitely makes me look at Destiny differently and makes me want to play even more.
Tolles Buch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Für meinen mystischen, poetischen Freund ist es ein tolles Geschenk!"
If you love the destiny story definitely get this.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love the destiny story definitely get this. It goes really in depth on some of the characters and stories surrounding them, stuff that hasnt been in the game yet (as playable content that is) yeah its just grimoire cards but the way its layed out is far better than reading through grimoire cards, it feels like a story instead of just facts about story sets."
"Bought for partner, he loves",5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it. He is majorly into destiny and this is such good quality. He now wants to collect all the books.
Parfait pour les fans des Destiny souhaitant approfondir leurs connaissances de l'univers du jeu.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Produit de qualité : couverture rigide en simili-cuir, pages épaisses, illustrations, textes aérés... Bref un vrai plaisir à bouquiner ! Et bon sang que c'est chouette d'en apprendre d'avantage sur les origines de nos adversaires mais aussi celles des conflits en cours.Ces légendes apporterons des réponses à vos questions, mais apporteront aussi d'autres questions sur la suite des événements contés, on se plonge assez rapidement dans la lecture.ATTENTION : ce livre n'existe pas encore en version française, et certains mots peuvent nécessiter l'emploi d'un traducteur."
