If a musician wrote a song or cut a record in 1970, say, he might - quite reasonably - have thought that this would bring in a handy few shillings for him throughout his life AND do the same for his children. (He probably wouldn't have considered any further down the family tree.) He would have relied upon the law as it stood, which is EXACTLY what we demand of all citizens. It would therefore be grossly unfair to change the copyright duration *retrospectively*, so Tom's 50-yr. rule would only apply to works published after the date of the rule's enactment. Therefore, the rule-change would only start to bear fruit 50 years afterwards, and it would only apply to a small portion of ""classic"" songs (because I believe that, in fifty years time, we'll still consider the 60s and 70s to be the golden age of pop and rock).

I wouldn't support the reduction of copyright term to anything *less* than the life of the author (I would even say that one ought to be able to leave a ""creative will"" for what sorts of adaptations are acceptable, but copying and distributing the work becomes legal). Twenty years would allow big corporations to adapt still-popular work without payment. As you state many, many times, anything small creators get legally, corporations also get.

A separate legal provision for copying for nonprofit and archival purposes could also be written into the law, which would probably be more likely to pass than trying to shorten the term.

This is only true if the law has to treat everyone the same, and it patently doesn't; the law is so riddled with iniquities that it is practically made of them, and I see no reason why we couldn't make one of those iniquities benefit the little guy.

And you touch on a more fundamental point, which I see as: copyright for individual people or small outfits is a band-aid patching over financial insecurity. Your survival should not depend on your stranglehold over your intellectual property, because (a) there should not be strangleholds over ideas and creativity, and (b) human beings are entitled to genuine security, not the caprices of creativity making money. But to give all humans genuine financial security would mean either overhauling the entire system or significantly reforming, neither of which seems likely to happen sadly. I think 50 years is a good term of copyright, at least for the original purposes of copyright as stated, but I could see it be even smaller, as long as individuals could be assured of safety. And the effect on big corporations would be smaller than one might think. If Star Wars were in the public domain now, then how many people would have had the capacity to create the sequel trilogy? Or to create the last four Star Wars video games? Or to distribute them and make all the money they did off them? Not that many people; certainly, not the individual creators who would love the chance to use the Star Wars IP for their own projects. Large corporations have institutional capacities that still mean they could make plenty of money off of public domain IP, it's just that they wouldn't have a stranglehold over it any more.",1,2022-07-17T23:11:39Z

Imagine if you made a song 20 years ago, and it got no attention whatsoever, not because of the lack of talent or people not wanting to listen to it but accessibility based on current limitations or services able to distribute that record. And if the holder dies, immediate public domain on it. I know I‚Äôll be doing that to anything I write, I‚Äôll make sure it all goes public domain.

Having your song ""stolen"", is not the same as having your car stolen - you haven't lost your song. The purpose of copyright should be to encourage the production of art. It should be about preserving a *public* good, not about making sure artists can get rich or even  make a living from their art.

To that end, I would be open to getting rid of copyright *completely* if other methods could achieve the same result. Good artists can make some money from supporters on Patreon or similar services while still letting the final product go into the wild for free.  I realize that big budget movies might not be made under these circumstances, but that actually seems like a plus. :)",1,2022-01-22T21:41:59Z

What you do see ALOT, is companies using copyright as a shield to target only bad reviews or videos showing how much of a buggy disaster their game is.  
The backlash has nothing to do with the copyright, the backlash is because the gaming community knows why they are using the copyright and that they are using it specifically to hide how terrible their product is and they want us the consumers to buy their disaster of a product before we realize it's a broken mess and ask for a refund.   The gaming community has had to put up for years with games being in an unplayable downright fraudulent state, SIC cyberpunk 2077 or games that are ideologically tainted SIC The Last of Us pt 2.  For example The Last of Us Pt2 had very clear ideology in the story that they knew would alienate and infuriate fans of the series, they did their utter best to make sure the public did not know this until release date in the hopes that they could get us to buy something we did not want, in other industries selling someone a product that turns out to be significantly different than advertised would be called fraud, but for some reason games developers can get away with this kind of behavior and use copyright as a weapon to prevent people from discovering their fraud. 

This is why gamers dislike companies using copyright because it's the motive behind the copyright not the copyright itself.",0,2022-01-19T23:33:49Z

Copyright's best used is to protect the lil' guy from hungry corporations who look to steal good ideas and profit off them. Why should it work the other way around? Disney, Universal, Big music companies, etc will not go under because some people are using, obtaining, and redistributing their works for free; however the starving artist trying to make a buck to put food on the table will end up homeless if their works are stolen from.

Relating to stock images and footage, if you put your work on the internet and don't expect it to get stolen; that's like going to the marketplace in Madrid with a stuffed wallet in your back pocket and expecting to have that wallet by the end of the day. Don't be ignorant and protect your work like you'd protect your wallet. If they are really worried about losing their work than they shouldn't have online portfolios.

Each and every one of us is the victim of theft; we are being deprived  of the value we would have derived from that material being free to use, and each day there are new offenses as works that otherwise would have entered the public domain are diverted, the ill-gotten gains of political lobbyists.

It seems to me that any past sale of copyright can now be revisited if the term of rights was stated (or even implied) to be the default term in force at the time. I think it plausible that a creator (especially one motivated less by profit and more by seeking the widest reach) would only accept the restrictions on duplication sold to a publisher as a *temporary, defined* means to that end. For the present rights holder to assert that copyright extension applies alters the thing sold (the rights) beyond recognition and to me that would void the entire contract. I'm speaking of an ideal world, not the illegitimate mess of legislation we are presently burdened with. I'm obviously not a lawyer as I possess common sense and don't want the mess to continue to the benefit of the legal profession (which is simultaneously the oldest profession, the two being essentially the same).

But you still have to make some good lyrics and make that fit into the song.

I absolutely dislike that mainstream artists have started kind of quoting songs more and more or remixing pre-existing music outright (as seen by Kygo and Felix Jaehn). I mean they are still making effort after all because these remixes have to sound appealing for their audience but i wish to hear some more originality.

Consider patents, where the term of patent protection is allegedly matched to the time period that a sufficient return on that investment can be made without compromising the creative abilities of others to advance the art and build on prior inventions. It is a balancing act, but the principle is to allow those who invest a day and a small budget on a project a chance to earn proportionate to that art, to allow the one who invested years writing a novel a chance to receive the reward for his sacrifice, and those who spend large sums investing in a production and seeding the arts a chance to reap the reward for their commitment.  I consider it unreasonable to ever allow any art to be copyright protected following the death of the artist. Corporations holding copyrights should have shorter protection tenure than individual holders.  Finally, a lot of content that has copyright claim is a derived work, and that also needs to be addressed, because the effort needed to produce 100% original art is magnitudes harder than reworking, repackaging, re-recording, assembling, or parroting prior art.",0,2021-12-05T23:54:41Z

If you work for something really hard you should be able to make money from it unless u chose otherwise in a contract when the copyright was issued so that way u can't take it back. I also think that unless there's NO creative work behind something using others work as well as no criticism or review then you should be sued otherwise go ahead. Ideas are built on other ideas, nothing is original, and having everything copyrighted even if u make something extremely creative that builds on the original work it can really kill space for creativity. ofc u gotta give credit tho",1,2021-11-25T01:31:24Z

Many people rememeber it fondly but it was never released on VHS and DVD (when that became a thing), much to everyone's displeasure. Rather a compilation was the only thing available which baffled many people.

The creators later explained that the live show contained many video clips from news shows, commercials, film reviews etc... but it was all fair use since the network it aired on is government funded and does not allow advertising. This meant that there was no revenue at all generated from the show, apart from absolute hilarity.

If however it they were to release complete episodes on DVD (Which they did plan on), the creators would have to contact EVERY SINGLE featured video creator, of which there were hundreds, making it a legal mess. Hence the compilation only featured clips that contained no licensed or copyrighted material.

I don't think it is a problem with the dmca system that people should complain about, but rather the people that abuse it. There are numerous companies and individuals that use it to either silence, troll, or even scam content creators. There are channels I have watched that are constantly fighting strikes and copyright claims on videos that involve police officers and their vest or dash cams because either the system YouTube uses to detect them thinks it's an episode of Cops or because some lawyer that's all the video thinks it's an episode. I have also seen instances where mysterious companies would pop up and claim a bunch of random videos and start collecting ad revenue from them. But as soon as somebody starts investigating to figure out who they are, they just disappear. You are right, this is not a problem with YouTube's copyright system. It's running as good as it can as it is. The problem is people. With any luck, the laws and systems in place now will be improved soon. But even if they end up becoming absolutely perfect, there will still be complaints. The thing about people is even when compromising, neither party really agrees with the arrangement. One wants more than the other in most cases. And there will always be those that try to exploit any system to get what they want at any cost",27,2021-10-12T19:33:26Z

It takes a lifetime of training and dedication to became a songwriter or musician. One-hit wonders don't happen by accident usually. They happen because one person spent his life writing song after song after song and just by chance one of them got recorded and made a hit. That's not just a few hundred people. That's the vast majority of the music business. It takes thousands of people churning away making failed songs for society as a whole to benefit from the froth that all that churning creates for the really good stuff to be made. If you don't let one hit wonders and failed songwriters have a chance at making a decent living on what they spend their lives doing, then they won't engage in all that churn, and the level of froth will drop. Quality will drop, variety will drop, innovation will come slower. When creativity becomes something only hobbyists with another source of income can do, rather than a possible profession, then we will all suffer as a society.

When it comes to non interactive cut scenes I can see that in that case there can be infringement, however when it comes to gameplay I would argue that you simply cannot understand the full work like you can with movies music or images because of the interactivity in them.

That will generally get people to second guess using content outside of their content. Obviously not perfect, what with confusion as to what's transformative and people wrongly using others hard work for free and what qualifies as an art piece that falls under copyright, but a good start.

Also, I believe there needs to be a good faith argument for allowing penalty free take downs so owners can keep their copyright and users can safely use it and remove it if there is accidental/unintentional infringement so companies can't sue individuals or platforms out of existence just for a 5 second moment in the video where the company owned song was in the background. Not entirely sure what the legal ramifications of this is (not a lawyer) but many small creators, in my opinion, don't intend to infringe copyright because they don't have/can't afford legal counsel nor can they afford the settlement offers of ""give us all your money from that video or we'll sue.""",1,2021-07-14T14:41:21Z

You do incredible work Tom. Hugely enjoy your videos and I often walk away feeling like I learned something worth while. This was so well done!

I have to say, though, Legality and fairness shouldn't have a paywall.
Lawyers bother me a lot.
That cheaper small claims court sounds like a step in the right direction and I'm sure it wouldn't be at all hard to restrict eligible applicants to individuals or companies of a small capital.

And why can't an individual's works be theirs until their death? The set 50 years is generous but the issue of it, likely, falling short of their lifespan means it will leave them without income in their most vulnerable period.",12,2021-07-13T11:01:33Z

i think that they should have a number of credits effectively that it costs to content claim something

if it was not and they were effectively abusing the system aiming for free money they don't
if they run out of credits they are able to pay for more with each one costing more than the last
and have the credits reset every year or some other pre defined period

though the issue with this is that it would require youtube's existing system to be executed at it is intended to be not just rushed through by the lowest bidder for easy money

i also think the same system should be used for disputing claims on a content creators content

this would allow for disputing false positives in content id and similar systems but heavily penalize automated services that just spam out DMCA claims at anything it even thinks it might be able to claim

Hiatus not included, but if a band says they disband, then their copywright ends. I think that makes sense. Old writers, such as johnny cash, well their family still is able to make money off of some of his last songs, even though they had no part in making it. And a writer just sitting back doing nothing 50 years after writing a big hit book because they still get copywright, even after doing nothing to earn it after 50 years? Not the most fair. But then you still need to account for 80's bands, as you said, where its been 40 years and their names are still huge. They should still get a piece of that, they created their image, we know its their image. So, i feel it'd work best to have it be when they publically ebd their career as an artist. Then, if they continue to actually rely on their works, they will still make money off of it, but once they're done with what they made, they're done. 5 years or so after might make sense still though for bands and writers who quit and then get big afterwards.",0,2021-07-07T16:27:07Z

Given the existential risk involved in physically fighting each other to acquire ownership of a resource, we have come to impose upon ourselves the ""civil"" alternative we call ""trade"". This necessarily imposes upon ourselves some kind of set of governing rules, to wit, an economic system, which necessarily puts price stickers on everything. Since we each have only a finite amount of resources (such as money) with which to trade at any given time, an economic system is a rationing system, allocating resources according to some or other criterion. (Capitalism, for example, allocates resources fundamentally according to the individual's innate ability to acquire them, which is unfair given that innate ability is unchosen, unalterable and personally unique, resulting in inequality of personal outcomes. Capitalism is also inefficient; for example, rival pharmacological companies not sharing commercially sensitive research‚Äîhiding research-discovery pieces of the same treatment jigsaw from each other‚Äîresulting in unnecessary duplication of effort and precluding the efficiency which is the building upon each other's research and discoveries. ""USSR communist-type"" economies stifle endeavour as the people are allocated resources equally no matter what any individual's productive output. *All* economic systems are unfair and inefficient, stifling progress, by definition.)

I think that the biggest problem, at least in the US, is not with copyright law itself but with how lawsuits are handled. The fact that a defendant (or plaintiff for that matter) in a lawsuit will have to pay their own legal fees regardless if they win or lose means that the mere threat of a lawsuit is enough to make people cave.
