# Dependencies
## PyTorch Library
Not really sure, but I think you have to do the install in your project terminal (like on PyCharm)
huggingface which I use for sentiment analysis requires the PyTorch Library
Follow install instructions on this site: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
Take note that this takes up about 2gb of storage
## Spacy en_core_web_md
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md 
en_core_web_md is used in spacy for part of speech tagging so you need to install this too
Like with PyTorch Library, I think you need to do the install in your project terminal.
Should take up about 40mb of storage
