If a musician wrote a song or cut a record in 1970, say, he might - quite reasonably - have thought that this would bring in a handy few shillings for him throughout his life AND do the same for his children. (He probably wouldn't have considered any further down the family tree.) He would have relied upon the law as it stood, which is EXACTLY what we demand of all citizens. It would therefore be grossly unfair to change the copyright duration *retrospectively*, so Tom's 50-yr. rule would only apply to works published after the date of the rule's enactment. Therefore, the rule-change would only start to bear fruit 50 years afterwards, and it would only apply to a small portion of ""classic"" songs (because I believe that, in fifty years time, we'll still consider the 60s and 70s to be the golden age of pop and rock). It would still be worth doing, mind, as it would pay off eventually, to some extent, but would the punters be satisfied with this outcome, or would they demand retrospective law-changes, regardless of jurists' objections?",1,2023-05-30T21:53:54Z

UgwrAc7wvWhI_TAuFS54AaABAg,0.02,0.825,0.155,0.9961,"Imagine a 20 ~ 50 year copyright period (from date of creation) for a young aspiring musician: they send their demo tracks to one of the big three labels. The lablel rejects it, but simultaneously archives it as a ""...maybe later"", whilst the songwriter gets zero traction or income from self-publishing efforts because they lack the time, energy, or money to produce and market those tracks themselves.

Years later, one of the big labels pulls that work from a timed archive, transforms it just enough for it to be considered a fresh interpretation on the original, kicking in <their> exclusive copyright term for 20 ~ 50 years.

They make bank. The original songwriter gets nothing.

Now imagine the same scenario for authors, scriptwriters, and all the other artists whose works might never get noticed for <years> until at some point that work resonates with the zeitgeist.

Copyright is, fundamentally, a <human right>, and it exists as a principle of balance between arts, science, and the general public, as found in Article 27 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights:

""27.1 Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.

27.2 Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.""

If you reduce copyright in the way this video suggests, you *massively* skew the balance away from creators, to their very great detriment - because although you think it would enrich society as a whole, the entities that would be best placed to benefit from <shorter> copyright durations are the very deep-pocketed monopolies and monopsonies that people accuse of being the beneficiaries of the current system.

That 20 ~50 year (from creation) term wouldn't suck for a tiny minority, but for <millions> of people around the world: the everyday artists trying to scratch out a hobby, a passion, or a side-hustle. Having those artists' work enter the public domain whilst they're still alive only benefits those who are agile enough to exploit it at scale.

Copyright is *your* right, and it is *your* protection against exploitation by corporate megaliths - artists of all kinds just need to learn what it is, what it isn't, and how to make it work for them.",0,2022-10-22T21:14:47Z

Twenty years would allow big corporations to adapt still-popular work without payment. As you state many, many times, anything small creators get legally, corporations also get.

A separate legal provision for copying for nonprofit and archival purposes could also be written into the law, which would probably be more likely to pass than trying to shorten the term.

This is only true if the law has to treat everyone the same, and it patently doesn't; the law is so riddled with iniquities that it is practically made of them, and I see no reason why we couldn't make one of those iniquities benefit the little guy.

And you touch on a more fundamental point, which I see as: copyright for individual people or small outfits is a band-aid patching over financial insecurity. Your survival should not depend on your stranglehold over your intellectual property, because (a) there should not be strangleholds over ideas and creativity, and (b) human beings are entitled to genuine security, not the caprices of creativity making money. But to give all humans genuine financial security would mean either overhauling the entire system or significantly reforming, neither of which seems likely to happen sadly. I think 50 years is a good term of copyright, at least for the original purposes of copyright as stated, but I could see it be even smaller, as long as individuals could be assured of safety. And the effect on big corporations would be smaller than one might think. If Star Wars were in the public domain now, then how many people would have had the capacity to create the sequel trilogy? Or to create the last four Star Wars video games? Or to distribute them and make all the money they did off them? Not that many people; certainly, not the individual creators who would love the chance to use the Star Wars IP for their own projects. Large corporations have institutional capacities that still mean they could make plenty of money off of public domain IP, it's just that they wouldn't have a stranglehold over it any more.",1,2022-07-17T23:11:39Z

I think a good way around this is the 20 year rule would be fine, except it applies not 20 years from the date that the copyrighted material was conceived, but 20 years after the last medium of copyrighted material under that umbrella was produced.

Like, if I made a song 20 years ago, and I released a song today, both of those songs would be covered under my copyright whilst I was making music. Imagine if you made a song 20 years ago, and it got no attention whatsoever, not because of the lack of talent or people not wanting to listen to it but accessibility based on current limitations or services able to distribute that record. And if the holder dies, immediate public domain on it. I know I‚Äôll be doing that to anything I write, I‚Äôll make sure it all goes public domain.

Having your song ""stolen"", is not the same as having your car stolen - you haven't lost your song. The purpose of copyright should be to encourage the production of art. It should be about preserving a *public* good, not about making sure artists can get rich or even  make a living from their art.

To that end, I would be open to getting rid of copyright *completely* if other methods could achieve the same result. Good artists can make some money from supporters on Patreon or similar services while still letting the final product go into the wild for free.  I realize that big budget movies might not be made under these circumstances, but that actually seems like a plus. :)",1,2022-01-22T21:41:59Z

What you do see ALOT, is companies using copyright as a shield to target only bad reviews or videos showing how much of a buggy disaster their game is.  
The backlash has nothing to do with the copyright, the backlash is because the gaming community knows why they are using the copyright and that they are using it specifically to hide how terrible their product is and they want us the consumers to buy their disaster of a product before we realize it's a broken mess and ask for a refund.   The gaming community has had to put up for years with games being in an unplayable downright fraudulent state, SIC cyberpunk 2077 or games that are ideologically tainted SIC The Last of Us pt 2.  For example The Last of Us Pt2 had very clear ideology in the story that they knew would alienate and infuriate fans of the series, they did their utter best to make sure the public did not know this until release date in the hopes that they could get us to buy something we did not want, in other industries selling someone a product that turns out to be significantly different than advertised would be called fraud, but for some reason games developers can get away with this kind of behavior and use copyright as a weapon to prevent people from discovering their fraud. 

This is why gamers dislike companies using copyright because it's the motive behind the copyright not the copyright itself.",0,2022-01-19T23:33:49Z

Copyright's best used is to protect the lil' guy from hungry corporations who look to steal good ideas and profit off them. Why should it work the other way around? Disney, Universal, Big music companies, etc will not go under because some people are using, obtaining, and redistributing their works for free; however the starving artist trying to make a buck to put food on the table will end up homeless if their works are stolen from.

Relating to stock images and footage, if you put your work on the internet and don't expect it to get stolen; that's like going to the marketplace in Madrid with a stuffed wallet in your back pocket and expecting to have that wallet by the end of the day. Don't be ignorant and protect your work like you'd protect your wallet. If they are really worried about losing their work than they shouldn't have online portfolios.

Each and every one of us is the victim of theft; we are being deprived  of the value we would have derived from that material being free to use, and each day there are new offenses as works that otherwise would have entered the public domain are diverted, the ill-gotten gains of political lobbyists.

It seems to me that any past sale of copyright can now be revisited if the term of rights was stated (or even implied) to be the default term in force at the time. I think it plausible that a creator (especially one motivated less by profit and more by seeking the widest reach) would only accept the restrictions on duplication sold to a publisher as a *temporary, defined* means to that end. For the present rights holder to assert that copyright extension applies alters the thing sold (the rights) beyond recognition and to me that would void the entire contract. I'm speaking of an ideal world, not the illegitimate mess of legislation we are presently burdened with. I'm obviously not a lawyer as I possess common sense and don't want the mess to continue to the benefit of the legal profession (which is simultaneously the oldest profession, the two being essentially the same).

I personally consider changing song texts also transformative content. It's not as much effort as taking notes and turn them into good sounding music from the ground up. But you still have to make some good lyrics and make that fit into the song.

I absolutely dislike that mainstream artists have started kind of quoting songs more and more or remixing pre-existing music outright (as seen by Kygo and Felix Jaehn). I mean they are still making effort after all because these remixes have to sound appealing for their audience but i wish to hear some more originality.

Consider patents, where the term of patent protection is allegedly matched to the time period that a sufficient return on that investment can be made without compromising the creative abilities of others to advance the art and build on prior inventions. It is a balancing act, but the principle is to allow those who invest a day and a small budget on a project a chance to earn proportionate to that art, to allow the one who invested years writing a novel a chance to receive the reward for his sacrifice, and those who spend large sums investing in a production and seeding the arts a chance to reap the reward for their commitment.  I consider it unreasonable to ever allow any art to be copyright protected following the death of the artist. Corporations holding copyrights should have shorter protection tenure than individual holders.

Rather a compilation was the only thing available which baffled many people.

The creators later explained that the live show contained many video clips from news shows, commercials, film reviews etc... but it was all fair use since the network it aired on is government funded and does not allow advertising. This meant that there was no revenue at all generated from the show, apart from absolute hilarity.

If however it they were to release complete episodes on DVD (Which they did plan on), the creators would have to contact EVERY SINGLE featured video creator, of which there were hundreds, making it a legal mess.

I don't think it is a problem with the dmca system that people should complain about, but rather the people that abuse it. There are numerous companies and individuals that use it to either silence, troll, or even scam content creators. There are channels I have watched that are constantly fighting strikes and copyright claims on videos that involve police officers and their vest or dash cams because either the system YouTube uses to detect them thinks it's an episode of Cops or because some lawyer that's all the video thinks it's an episode. I have also seen instances where mysterious companies would pop up and claim a bunch of random videos and start collecting ad revenue from them. But as soon as somebody starts investigating to figure out who they are, they just disappear. You are right, this is not a problem with YouTube's copyright system. It's running as good as it can as it is. The problem is people. With any luck, the laws and systems in place now will be improved soon. But even if they end up becoming absolutely perfect, there will still be complaints. The thing about people is even when compromising, neither party really agrees with the arrangement. One wants more than the other in most cases. And there will always be those that try to exploit any system to get what they want at any cost",27,2021-10-12T19:33:26Z

It takes a lifetime of training and dedication to became a songwriter or musician. One-hit wonders don't happen by accident usually. They happen because one person spent his life writing song after song after song and just by chance one of them got recorded and made a hit. That's not just a few hundred people. That's the vast majority of the music business. It takes thousands of people churning away making failed songs for society as a whole to benefit from the froth that all that churning creates for the really good stuff to be made. If you don't let one hit wonders and failed songwriters have a chance at making a decent living on what they spend their lives doing, then they won't engage in all that churn, and the level of froth will drop. Quality will drop, variety will drop, innovation will come slower. When creativity becomes something only hobbyists with another source of income can do, rather than a possible profession, then we will all suffer as a society.

When it comes to non interactive cut scenes I can see that in that case there can be infringement, however when it comes to gameplay I would argue that you simply cannot understand the full work like you can with movies music or images because of the interactivity in them.

That will generally get people to second guess using content outside of their content. Obviously not perfect, what with confusion as to what's transformative and people wrongly using others hard work for free and what qualifies as an art piece that falls under copyright, but a good start.

Also, I believe there needs to be a good faith argument for allowing penalty free take downs so owners can keep their copyright and users can safely use it and remove it if there is accidental/unintentional infringement so companies can't sue individuals or platforms out of existence just for a 5 second moment in the video where the company owned song was in the background. Not entirely sure what the legal ramifications of this is (not a lawyer) but many small creators, in my opinion, don't intend to infringe copyright because they don't have/can't afford legal counsel nor can they afford the settlement offers of ""give us all your money from that video or we'll sue.""",1,2021-07-14T14:41:21Z

i think that they should have a number of credits effectively that it costs to content claim something
if their claim was valid and appropriate they get the credit refunded
if it was not and they were effectively abusing the system aiming for free money they don't
if they run out of credits they are able to pay for more with each one costing more than the last
and have the credits reset every year or some other pre defined period

though the issue with this is that it would require youtube's existing system to be executed at it is intended to be not just rushed through by the lowest bidder for easy money

i also think the same system should be used for disputing claims on a content creators content

this would allow for disputing false positives in content id and similar systems but heavily penalize automated services that just spam out DMCA claims at anything it even thinks it might be able to claim

Copyright law is very difficult to enforce when the content is literally shared in what amounts to an open theater. You're intentionally broadcasting an image, a video, in a way you know that it can be downloaded. Often these images and videos come with encouraging messages to ""share"" the content.

What do you think is going to happen? If I set my wallet down in the center of a busy market, I wouldn't expect people to ignore it. It's my wallet. It has my identification inside. The contents belong to me. But that doesn't mean someone else won't pick it up.

Hiatus not included, but if a band says they disband, then their copywright ends. I think that makes sense. Old writers, such as johnny cash, well their family still is able to make money off of some of his last songs, even though they had no part in making it. And a writer just sitting back doing nothing 50 years after writing a big hit book because they still get copywright, even after doing nothing to earn it after 50 years? Not the most fair. But then you still need to account for 80's bands, as you said, where its been 40 years and their names are still huge. They should still get a piece of that, they created their image, we know its their image. So, i feel it'd work best to have it be when they publically ebd their career as an artist. Then, if they continue to actually rely on their works, they will still make money off of it, but once they're done with what they made, they're done. 5 years or so after might make sense still though for bands and writers who quit and then get big afterwards.",0,2021-07-07T16:27:07Z

Given the existential risk involved in physically fighting each other to acquire ownership of a resource, we have come to impose upon ourselves the ""civil"" alternative we call ""trade"". This necessarily imposes upon ourselves some kind of set of governing rules, to wit, an economic system, which necessarily puts price stickers on everything. Since we each have only a finite amount of resources (such as money) with which to trade at any given time, an economic system is a rationing system, allocating resources according to some or other criterion. (Capitalism, for example, allocates resources fundamentally according to the individual's innate ability to acquire them, which is unfair given that innate ability is unchosen, unalterable and personally unique, resulting in inequality of personal outcomes. Capitalism is also inefficient; for example, rival pharmacological companies not sharing commercially sensitive research‚Äîhiding research-discovery pieces of the same treatment jigsaw from each other‚Äîresulting in unnecessary duplication of effort and precluding the efficiency which is the building upon each other's research and discoveries. ""USSR communist-type"" economies stifle endeavour as the people are allocated resources equally no matter what any individual's productive output. *All* economic systems are unfair and inefficient, stifling progress, by definition.)

I think that the biggest problem, at least in the US, is not with copyright law itself but with how lawsuits are handled.

Whatever enters PD should still respect the original work. Say your 50yr/20yr plan comes into play, and your copyright is a active intellectual property, such as is interacted with on a daily basis by a large audience or is used as a consistent means of income to a party, how are you specifically accommodating the creator/ self employment stability of that creator. I can understand static works that have no financial repercussions as in the author has no desire to profit from it. 

But put yourself in the eyes of craftsmen/ tradesmen/ artisans and artists, etc; that hone there skill religiously for years to have their vision completely ripped from them because the public is throwing a tantrum because you have been playing toooo long with a specific toy you made, it's comparable to having your house ripped from beneath your feet because you stayed there too long and it's someone else's turn, but you ""own"" it as in it is ""yours"". Copyright is there to protect the owner, so therefore that waver on a 20 year policy you proposed defeats the purpose of copyright itself. It should remain a lifetime affair, if it becomes a recognizable brand it should remain a copyright in next of kin or party of kin up until they decide it to be PD.

Or better yet place yourself in a position where your videos lose revenue because they have entered public domain..... but whine about the ""private media outlet"" despite it being a private institution that broadcasts media and profits, then pays employees who have livelihoods too and belong to the public, do you think you're suddenly not going to want your IP? You filed a case against this entity?  seriously it's hypocritical to just think about it. Transformative content should be redefined not copyright

The problem on YouTube is not Copyright but rather copyright abusers who abuse the system to claim things they DO NOT OWN. and bet on creators not noticing or not bothering to dispute and appeal.

I suggest solutions:
1. A claimer MUST provide active contact email for direct negotiations.
2. Keep a credibility record system for the percent of successful and failed claims of each claimer and increasing and reducing their power based on that. (Fair and solves the copyright abuse huge issue on YouTube).
3. For God's Sake, the title, description, comment, and community section, should SUPPORT RTL LANGUAGES LIKE ARABIC, by now!

The game used music licenced by Kevin MacLeod. The music is technically royalty free, but they got a licence from him anyway.
One piece was later used by a musician since it is royalty free. This particular piece was playing when a player got their rocket just past the barrier between atmosphere and space. A fairly common occurrence for players in a game about rockets and space exploration.

This musician added some windchimes on top of the existing track and uploaded it to YouTube, as-is, as their own creation. This was allowed, according to the licence.
This musician then had a rights management company take care of this piece of music, and they added the song in its entirety to the Content ID library.

What followed was a couple of hundreds of thousands of Let's Play videos instantly being flagged for copyright infringement. Back when YouTube had a 3-strike rule that applied to Content ID matches as well.
A LOT of people lost their channels that day. A lot never regained them, even after this whole ordeal was sorted out.
A lot of those who did never returned to YouTube.

This, for me, was the single biggest display of how skewed the system is. This system which apparently isn't broken.

But here is where the problem starts: this 12 second segment is part of a video with a total length of over 20 minutes, that's less than 1% of the entire video. I spent a lot of time into recording, editing and rendering. Now i put about 4h work into this one video and all revenue generated, the result of those 4 hours of work get taken away from me for 1% of the video that is overlayed with heavy sounds of gunfire. I don't say I own 100% of the video, they own that 1% as it was a cutscene and it wasn't transformative, so I would be willing to give them a small ammount of the revenue, but not 100%.

Sure if you are a billionaire you can pay for the rights to do and use things, but for the common people it's now a matter of not being seen.

Can I even watch a movie with someone? You may think so, but if the volume is too loud it can still be copyright infringement. If the device you play it on somehow edits the files while playing it, it can be copyright infringement. Essentially we're all walking an ever thinner tightrope.

And patents are just as bad. Patenting methods to use things... And there are so many copyrighted works now, how would you know if you create/write something, that it's not infringing on rights? Good luck paying to find out. And they can sue you even if it isn't remotely infringing copyright. But do you have the money to defend your innocence?

Firstly, it wasn't ran through a pixelation filter, it was drawn, and I imagine it took a considerable amount of time to make and used artistic skills very different to what the photographer used to take the photo.  It was a piece of art, in its own right, that was based upon the look of Miles Davis.
There are hundreds of images and videos of Miles Davis showing him at so many different angles.  Does that mean if someone draws an image of Miles Davis from memory or imagination at an angle that happens be the same angle as one of the photos or videos, they are infringing copyright?  Andy Baio did admit that the drawing was based upon the photo but that's not relevant when you consider that the end result is two separate works of art showing Miles Davis at the same angle.

 A photographer owns the photo, not the angle.

If someone takes a photo of Joe Biden at a press conference and another photographer moves into that spot and ends up taking a photo that looks almost exactly alike, who is infringing who's copyright when they go to sell their photos?

Also, yes, fair use should be *massively* expanded for non-commercial use, and any sort of compensation or penal action on the side of the defendant should be void. Cease-and-desist should be the maximum damage that can be incurred.

Non-commercial derivative works with substantial alterations should simply be fair use, and something like Youtube's content-ID system certifying the substantial alteration should be enough to close the case in favour of the defendant, or at least shift the burden of proof.

On a wider note, the system is broken in more ways: People shouldn't need to worry about making a living. If capitalism can't provide free housing, for example, capitalism is a failure that needs to be abolished. I believe it can provide free housing, so I think capitalism doesn't need to be abolished.

Uploaded gameplay tends to initiate interest. So many people get into many games *because* they saw videos on it and it looked fun. It‚Äôs massive free publicity, free advertising. Why do you think so many games companies *are* now okay with it? It probably does indeed ‚Äúpay the rent‚Äù, and then some. Do you think Microsoft is a kind of generous company?

They often pick up uses that NO human would challenge - thus creating unfair claims.  For example, I had a video of an RC helicopter flight copyright struck due to a reflection of a tv-show being played in a window that was visible for just a handful of frames with no audio.  It was hardly visible, and certainly unrelated to the video - and nothing a HUMAN lawyer nor viewer would have noticed.  I don't make a career on YouTube, and it is an unacceptable grab for systems like these.  If we are going to be judged by AI systems there must be more transparency, more content creator control, and the ability to challenge claims fairly and test with these same tools.  Not all impacted videos are 'reaction videos' or other potentially actually copyright-infringing videos.",1,2021-02-16T00:24:21Z
UgzAVBfYW9zWBrX3aeR4AaABAg,0.086,0.843,0.072,-0.2387,my opinion is they should do ads on copyrighted material and just split that money.  As long as the YouTuber is actually making content and not just reposting.  If license was affordable I wouldn't mind paying.   It would either be money for both or neither and if it gets no views then it essentially doesn't exist.  I agree though youtube is much better than it was in the beginning.  If I was making a movie or TV show for a massive audience it would be feasible.  on a side note I had licensed a song and it was like 40 bucks up to like 10 mil views 600 bucks for over that.  I kinda think that's a fair low risk deal for most people.  It really seems worse to me that people can file bogus claims.,0,2021-02-16T00:20:24Z

Ugxb6tjZ4pdPtRxYmSR4AaABAg,0.021,0.825,0.154,0.989,"I think the ""declared value copyright"" system would be a much better solution to replace the current system. The idea is as follows: you get 2 (two) year copyright with similar terms as today and you can extend the copyright for as long as you want for a registration fee. The registration fee is 1% of the declared value of the works per year. Anybody who pays copyright owner the declared value *frees* the work to public domain. The list of registered works and the declared values of each work are public.

Example: Disney creates the New Lion King movie. They get 2 year copyright for free. If they want a longer copyright protection they have to decide a price tag for the works. Let's say they decide ""900 million dollars"". That means that they have to pay 9 million dollars to the society to extend the copyright for an another year. And if many enough fans want to free the New Lion King, they can create growdfunding project to collect 900 million dollars to pay Disney and release that movie to public domain.

The fee part makes sure that copyright owner will not adjust the price too high. And the ability to release the work makes sure that works can enter public domain if the declared value is priced too low to avoid fees.

It also makes much easier to *check* if any given work is public domain. If any given work is older than 2 years and it has not been registered, it's public domain. And once you create something, you have 2 years to decide if you think *you* can monetize it in the future. And you can always get an extra year by paying 1% of the any value you want to specify. Just remember that if you declare that your work is worth $1, *anybody* can turn it to public domain by paying you that sum.",0,2021-02-10T15:16:25Z

If the distribution of that photo requires more labor, than the people who distribute the photo should get paid for that labor. 
No other worker gets paid for work that they might have done 70 years ago, why are novelists and painters at all different. If a plumber fixes my toilet, I don't then pay them for the right to use it. Furthermore, in order to get paid for work you don't do, someone must go without payment for work they did do.

1. Semi joking/serious what if you made a reaction video reacting to other people's reaction videos? I presume you would do this under the context of satire with the emphasis that reaction videos are a bit moronic of a concept.

2. How does a website/company like shutterstock just....'have' the legal right or w/e to all those images? I guess same question would be for universal music group or whatever they're called. Do you just get a business license saying 'hey i own this stuff and sell the licensing for it to people, thats our business model'.

3. Reguarding games getting exposure, the content creator getting paid and not the game company etc, (and bear with this streatch) but its a bit like a free advertisement. If im going to pay my money for something worth a day's wage or more I'm going to want to do my 'homework'. Research reviews, get second opinions, look at similar products. In this case, a content creator gives us a window and a bit more of insight than the shiny and catered perspective of a game's Trailer. If i see a half hour of footage of someone experiencing the game, I'm probably still going to buy or avoid buying the product based on its relevance to me. Theres no doubt any number of examples of products that people purchase only to be dissapointed that it wasn't going to serve the function they intended or as effective as they had thought it would be (i.e. fad gymn equipment gimmic)",0,2021-01-23T14:21:13Z

Meaning very very few people compared to the number who actually see it understand how it functions which means it is opened to abuse deliberate or otherwise.  That everything exists in a gray area is why this set of laws is (or just feels) broken.  If I speed I as a layman can understand the law, how I broke it and even have a reasonable understanding of what penalties I will have.  Copyright is nothing like that, it is inherently designed so that laypeople can not understand it and the penalties can vary from a warning to astronomical fines and even possible jail time if those fines aren't paid or can't be paid.  The fact that this can is being kicked further and further down the road even though Generation X, Y, Z and beyond have been on the internet most of their life is just wrong!  That we allow this to be treated as new technology is just wrong, and is broken.  If image hosting sites and video streaming services have to defend their existence to make these laws more reasonable and understandable then we should push for that.  That Spotify pays for the music on their service but YouTube pretends it is a problem that is too large and too complex is just wrong.",0,2021-01-21T22:26:50Z

The extent of that which can be owned by some who have benefited the most from these definitions is staggering. In essence, it is not unreasonable to say that all speech, nay even lives, could through legality be denied because of perceiving these definitions as societal law.  Definitions that in part evolved through precedent that a greater majority do not understand,  and in lack of understanding were susceptible to great loss.  Definitions that outside the provable realm of ownership of individual creative process was the claim by legal writ to things like the bulk of natural resource in major regions of the globe. Claim, that left the inhabitants of those areas without resource and by degree dependent on those who layed legal claim to said resource  To participate as an individual in making yourself dependent on these definitions is the surest legal guarantee to have no voice in relation to them.  That which is dependent is governed by the thing it is dependent upon.  The one thing I am most thankful for everyday is not having my individual benefit tied to these fractal definitions of what is owned. In this, like the majority that I am part of, I own nothing by these definitions. In owning nothing, is not being susceptible to having what is not owned claimed by legal definition.  I am not the example for others in these ways. If anyone wishes to come to a different understanding of their own lives through different process than what  has been established through precedent merely accept the burden that is not the guarantee of individual benefit.  Carrying any burden/weight is an act that allows us to come an understanding based upon the burden accepted. Most chose the burden that they believed to be for their benefit.  Different burden accepted is different understanding. All understanding in relation to burdens carried is needed in our collective advancement. Tell your story. if it is outside the norm of these legal definitions, for it is just as important as what the ""norm is defining as important.",0,2020-12-28T15:00:58Z

As you mentioned, copyright law is intended to prevent others from profiting from the creativity of artists and authors, I do not believe that any term less than the natural life of the artist or author would be sufficient. I think creators should be entitled to defend their creative works from unlawful exploitation until the end of the year in which they die. Your argument that extended duration of copyright stifles creation baffles me - copyright stimulates creation by allowing creators of *original* (emphasis added) works to profit from their work. If the work is not original, then it would not meet the criteria for copyright, so I'm not sure how a reduced duration of copyright would benefit creators. I think the comparison with the duration of patents is flawed - the innovations and inventions protected by patents are, by and large, for public benefit and the advancement of society as a whole. I don't think the same argument can be made for creative works.

The second point I wish to make is in relation to fair dealing vs fair use.  In the UK (and in Australia where most of our laws are based on UK laws), acts that constitute fair dealing is defined in legislation, so there is less room to argue what kind of use constitutes ""fair dealing"", and is far less ambiguous than the ""fair use"" system favoured in the US. I particularly enjoyed the last portion of the video in which you spoke about the intellectual property court in the UK, and how a similar but flawed system is being proposed in the US.

A few months later to clear the claim I removed the few seconds I used in the video and the video later just seemed like a bunch of nonsense without the few seconds of footage. It wasn't very successful either by my channel's standards back then. It luckily got shoved under the rug but I still didn't turn it private or delete it because it's the only video of mine that got copyright claimed and I think it's something to reminisce on and laugh at,if not now, years later.

Let's say someone levels a copyright strike against your video.  You're convinced the claimant is wrong, and that your video doesn't violate copyright.  You provide your full legal contact information so the claimant can sue you directly, and file a counter-claim with YouTube.

Under America's DMCA, YouTube has the right to say ""Okay, we're putting your video back up unless the claimant can prove he's taking legal action against you.  According to the DMCA's Safe Haven laws, so long as we provide your legal information to the claimant, YouTube can no longer be sued over your video.  We wash our hands of you.""

But that's NOT WHAT YOUTUBE DOES.  Instead, they REVIEW your counter-claim and DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES whether THEY think you violated copyright or not.  There is no lawyer involved, certainly no judge, just a quick bureaucratic yes-or-no decision.  If some yahoo who got assigned to answer the counter-claims today thinks you violated copypright because his bowels are acting up, YouTube will REJECT YOUR COUNTER-CLAIM and keep your video disabled (and keep the copyright strike against you).",1,2020-12-23T01:35:18Z

Speaking of MST3k.... at the end of their stuff, for many years, was an ack that one reason why they got famous was people sharing videos of their stuff well outside their original market -- ""Keep sharing the tapes"". This is probably one of the most glaring examples of the benefits of piracy under the correct circumstances. Most people would never have even heard of MST3k if it had been stuck in its own little UHF Minneapolis market...

In other words, their performances are nominally public domain, they've relinquished their own copyright over them.

But you could probably still shut that down if you wanted, by invoking the ""It's A Wonderful Life"" trick. 

As you are likely aware, the studios screwed up, and allowed the copyright for ""It's A Wonderful Life"" to lapse, meaning that it fell into the public domain, and any network could play it for free. And so, for about a decade it got played... and played.... and played.... anywhere near Xmas -- it was free advertising money for the stations that aired it... and anytime they had nothing better to put on, ""Boom, there it is!""

Then some Bright Boy lawyer registered a copyright on the soundtrack (or perhaps a synchronization license? Dunno)... and, while you could play it as a silent movie, you now can't play it with the audio track...

In a possibly similar thing, while MST3k itself is likely in the public domain, and legal to distribute (though not assessed as such by the courts, it seems improbable that ""Keep circulating the tapes"" would not be adjudicated as a mostly complete release of all rights, certainly for non-commercial distribution) -- while MST3k had licensed the original movies for their own performances, that doesn't mean they were necessarily licensed for repeated performances, which yet another Bright Boy lawyer could use to gain control over their distribution and performance.",0,2020-12-10T16:29:48Z

When creating a law that is suppose to have final say over what is legal and what isnt, especially when it comes to something as simple as using a video or a piece of music, there should be NO grey area. It should be cut and dry simple. Having those grey areas is what allows big corporations to effectively screw over the little guy, even if they did NOTHING wrong all because they can't afford to pay the legal fees in order to defend themselves.  They have effectively locked people's ability to defend themselves behind a Pay wall. So it doesn't matter if your 100% in the right, did everything the correct way and the corporation that is sueing you is just being greedy bastards trying to literally STEAL your money.  If you can't afford to fight it in court, at best you just have to  remove the content you depend on for money and at worst you end up paying out a lot of money to a corporation that legally doesn't deserve it. The current copyright laws have made a modern day version of highway robbery a VERY easy thing to do and for large companies a lot of the times a VERY lucrative business practice that some businesses are completely centered around. This end up leaving smaller individual content creators with no way of defending themselves.  So regardless if this is how it is, it NEEDS to change. Governments around the world are not changing with the times. They can no longer afford to let laws sit around unchanged for 10 years, let alone for 50 or 100 years like they use to. Technology and our society are moving forward at a break neck speed, and the law needs to keep up or risk becoming obsolete or even creating worse problems then they were created to fix.",0,2020-11-29T14:42:38Z

Is it the chords I used? Chords don‚Äôt belong to anyone, and if they did, music companies would be suing each other relentlessly because so many songs use the same chords and in the same order (ex: Ed Sheeran lawsuit).

Is it the melody? I can adjust it and add a little improvisation or keep the chorus melody but change the melody of the verses or maybe do one of a million things that can make my cover just slightly different from the original.

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that there is no clear distinction between copyrighted work and my own work. It would be much simpler if everything published online would be public domain, which would also solve piracy and censorship to a degree.",0,2020-11-28T00:43:25Z

We have to for a huge majority of the time rely on works in public domain. We do a bunch of shakespeare, because you can go absolutely wild on it with no copyright. Actually, probably some of the most creative things we've done were with shakespeare. I just had an absolute moment of HORROR when I imagined we'd have to pay on that. Or were absolutely fixed and forced to remain 100% true to one version. No. that WOULD be the end of us. 
And second, shorter terms for that would be brilliant. Do you know how often we have conversations complaining about people's death dates because they died less than 70 years ago? How we sit there dammit, couldn't they have died earlier--because no, we don't want them to have died earlier. we'd just love to interpret their works. We recently celebrated that GB Shaw is just above 70 years dead this month because we can now use his works. 
I don't really have a conclusion for this. Just a small rant from a theatre person, because in this aspect I often encounter that.

Just another reminder to everybody: fair use is meaningless to most people, as they often violate it themselves or are not capable of proving it in a court due to costs (which are high due to hours of work and the potential costs of defeat).

We can essentially just keep rolling the dice with Content ID and such, or be prepared to walk away from it all. Sucks, but until both copyright isn't as long term and fair use is a more accessible defense, the copyright owners hold all the cards and power.

Not that they shouldn't, but nobody should be shocked by this abusive behaviour, nor should anyone presume good intentions from a corporation in the business of copyright enforcement or acquisition. The whole ""plus author's lifespan"" bit should NEVER have been permitted. If we're serious about NOT inheriting wealth (we are, but even so), the descendants of a great author shouldn't be capable of living a life of luxury from their work. Stop the corporations from acquiring  copyrights they put NO EFFORT into creating, and then make money off of said copyrights' violations. The fact that's even legal is disgusting (should be closest living blood descendants, that's it if beyond author lifespan).

MuseScore was originally meant to be an online community where people could share sheet music with one another, and there was a premium option that gave you a few boosts. It was the place to go if you wanted free sheet music. And there were titles on there that technically *didn't* constitute fair use, but also other parodies too, since it was a community.

Everything was fine. No one did anything, it was a community. Everyone understood, it was ""widely understood"" as you put it that people did not have malign intentions in publishing this music.

A few months back MuseScore announced that because they couldn't possibly pay royalties to authors with only ads, they had to make almost every feature you could do with a work by an author (like downloading, etc.) paid.

Fast forward to now -- 90% of the content originally on the platform, 99% of all ""major song"" titles are gone, copyright-striked by companies like Kobalt. All that's really left on this (IMO) once great, but now paid platform is a few custom creations and stuff that's left in the public free-to-use domain. However, they still do provide a good tool for creating your own content.

And as for 'short-term' fixes that would help more imho than the constant flow of bandaid fixes copyright anddmca have seen, it should be a thing that frequent bad-faith/fasle dmca claimsneed to result in reduced chances of such cases from that individual or company being successful, like the entire copyright troll legal issue that there isno harsh penalty for dmca abuse. Imho if a case for a dmca claim doesmakeitto court, there should also be a genuine risk for the claimant should they be proven it is either a flat-out false claim, bad faith OR that they struck down blatant fair use (such as musical composition analasys and explanation) rather than the current iteration wherethe big recordlabelshave nothing to lose with their dmca abuse.
As a small scale author,i do agree that shortening copyright is reasonable, if done to a sensible degree, and 'till death+ 70 years' for individual creators is insane and realistically too long. But the soleprotection of copyright law and dmca should not be for the copyright holder. If i were to strike down amy and all content that discusses my writing in a fair use way, clearly being analasys and criticism, i SHOULD LOSE the right to strike and have no risk on my end. Current law does favor the copyright holder in every way, which inmany is good,but the ability to throw rampant floodsof unlawful claims needs to have risks associated beyond the 'if they can bring it to court we should drop the claim cuz expensive' to the point that it would be better to provide amneties that should copyrught claims on fair use or in blatant bad faith come from a single entity, there need to be waysto cause them reprcussions regardless if they drop the claim, and that should include low-cost starting options for the person being struck and mandatory for the copyright claimant to attend while that court does also have the right to enforce the decision (much like the U.K. version) 
In short, while the copyright holders should not have their protection lessened,there needto be enacted harsh repercussions dor unlawful claims that ANY individual could recognize as fair use to prevent dmcaabuse as it happensnowadays and that means a need to uodate and entirwly rework copyright law in a way that makes sense for the current era.

It should only apply to people who have like 100k views or above. Otherwise it should be the wild west. Copyright shouldn't prevent creativity, and the internet should be a place of creativity above all else. Large media companies who want another couple million from the creative work they bought on bargain from a struggling artist can go screw themselves. The key here should be less legislation and restriction, reduce time before works move to public domain, and those with small audiences like community theaters and small youtube creators should be able to use what they want in the name of creativity. If they start making serious money on something, then that is a different discussion. Individuals who own copyright on their own creative works should get all their copyright revenue, but huge mega corps with CEOs earning 8 and 9 figure salaries who own an astronomical amount of copyrights they had no creative hand in actually making, and have draconian exploitative contracts with the actual creators of the content should have their cut heavily taxed, with the revenue from that tax going to national and local art and creative initiatives. Individuals should get paid for their work, huge companies whose entire purpose is to make money from someone else's work (and are the real copyright 'infringers' for that reason) should not. And that is what is truly infuriating about this whole situation. It isn't a problem that people want to make money from their work, it is that the only people who are actually benefiting from the current system are huge companies with tons of money and lots of lawyers, and not the people who actually contribute to the furthering of art, culture, and creative endeavors.",0,2020-11-10T08:59:48Z

UgyqZpksSgLHIA4_lEJ4AaABAg,0.06,0.82,0.12,0.9107,"Great video Tom! After living in the african nation of Zambia for some time, I discovered that they are less focused on civil law and more focused on common law. When you talk about the ""widespread understanding"" it reflects the legal theory of the ""reasonable person test."" Essentially, what would a reasonable person understand about the issue at hand? Zambia focuses on common law more and civil law only practically takes precedence on high profile cases. Common law is more widely used in their local courts and I believe this is both a good and bad thing. As you've discussed in your video most civil laws take decades to catch up with the norm, or what society dictates. If the court focuses on common law their decisions don't have to be fully dictated by what the civil law states, that way they can be flexible as social understandings change. The downside to this is that common can be heavily variable, changing from day to day. This makes it difficult to predict if an action will be considered legal/acceptable or illegal/unacceptable. The slow civil law makes it easier to predict if an action would be considered unfair. I do think that big companies abuse these systems because they want every single penny of profit, and in some cases it's justified but others it is straight up unfair. Until civil law can update and be as flexible as common law, common law should be recognized with equal consideration as the civil law. This is issue is a very difficult one and I'm glad you created such a funny and informative video!",0,2020-11-09T00:04:03Z

Almost the entire video is just ""this thing you thought is legal, is not"". Which is great and all. But does not make youtube system not actually broken. Because for all that many many instances of copyright infringement are legitimate. There are also many many examples where the copyright strike is not legitimate.
This video would be more accurately called ""why many to most individual examples of youtube copyright system being broken is actually not youtube's fault but the law's fault"". or even a ""youtube's system is not broken in the way people think"". But many examples does not an always make, and even if it did, there are some broken parts of the system.

The youtube system does not actually allow you to say ""youtube, stop helping, I am taking them to court"". instead youtube takes over for the courts and just steals the creator's money to give to the copyright claimant, or just removes all the content with no recourse.
This is not something required by law but something youtube decided to do on their own. Youtube system can be helpful to ""a kid that accidentally infringed"". but is not helpful for people who did not and actually want to sue the false claimant

Plus youtube has some really stupid arbitrary restrictions. an aggressor can issue an infinite number of a strikes but a defender can only defend against 3 at once. Again not a legal requirement but something youtube is doing just to screw the small guy

>Holliwood and big corps can't do that. maybe there should be different treatment between a kid on the internet and a big corp, but in current copyright law there is not.

UgzAJmpHHiKN8XSb1J54AaABAg,0.042,0.792,0.166,0.991,"What if instead of reducing copyright, we just added in provisions for independent creators. A universal 80/20 split for profits with the corporations getting the majority. Content ID could be used and expanded to cover not just videos and music but also images as well. Do away with the manual reporting, though, and place the burden on the companies to add their works into it. From where I stand as a former artist and YouTube creator, the parties want only one thing each. Artists want to be credited, companies want to make money, and creators want to create. Expanding Content ID and rewriting copyright law would please everyone. It would allow for artists to never be miscreated (and receive a portion of royalties from their label), it would allow for their labels and copyright owners to make their money, and it would allow content creators to share their projects while also providing a small financial incentive to take up the trade. You won't find millionaire creators anymore, but that's ok. It would still be enough to make a modest living doing it full time and every new creator that gets on board is another revenue stream for the copyright holders as well. Obviously there would have to be some limitations to prevent strait re-uploads or low-effort copying of works and, as it stands, it would only benefit YouTube in the short term as there would need to be other similar methods rolled out to other sites hosting copyrighted content but I do feel that everyone benefits from this. This way, copyright could last forever. No one would have to worry about items not being in the public domain cause the public domain would become obsolete. There would be no use for it when everyone is not only allowed to use copyrighted content in videos but also earn from them. I'm sure there are other legal issues that are entangled up in this solution and I'd love to debate those in the replies to this comment and find a way around them though.",0,2020-10-22T14:24:40Z

Yes, yes I do. It's called performance and fans, good music will always make money.

People using other peoples music doesn't make the artist less money, unless they are specifically claiming that it's their song when it is not, there should be a disclaimer exception.

This doesn't change the fact that greed is being put before sharing and recognizing when you're music is being complimented. If you allow a song to be complimented it will increase the popularity and spread of that song.

I always pondered a 'loosening' of copyright would be good after some time. While you would not be able to just resell the original works on it's own, there would be a lot more freedom with archiving and remixing the works.

What's the legality around trademarked names being featured and reviewed in blogs and on review websites etc.? 
.
The other thing is that lots of entitled small people who pull creations from bigger people (or perceived bigger people) and claim 'fair use' but who would be outraged if their clip was used by big companies without payment/credit, or who pinch fellow small folks' clips and yet wouldn't pinch big clips for fear of being expensively sued, is that the fear of being sued doesn't equate to conscience over copyright infringement: if that danger wasn't there they would do it without hesitation, and yet still expect credit/payment the other way round, because they believe that if someone can pay big bucks for a smaller person's creation then they should, but that people who wouldn't be able to pay to use creations not only shouldn't have to, but shouldn't be made to feel bad for not doing so. Until those people can be made to feel that small people ripping off each other or ripping off big people is as intrinsically unfair as big people ripping off small people, they won't have any conscience about trying to get away with ripping off what they can rip off without having to pay or credit creators. Even if they know that it's illegal, and even if they know WHY it isn't fair use. 
.
The real problem, I think, is a) envy on the part of people with ordinary income, of anyone or any company assumed to have made big money, and even a sense of communistic entitlement to a share of that big money, proportional to the perceived financial privilege gap between the big person and themselves, leading to resentment at perceived 'stinginess' and 'hoarding' if the big person insists on money/payment despite being perceived as having plenty of money relative to the person wanting to use their creations (""you have so much money thanks to us anyway - it's immoral to make your films so expensive to buy, so you have it coming to you and you deserve it""), b) believing that the big people can spare the money loss anyway, and it wouldn't even be a significant dent or scratch on their resources, so it's unreasonable of big people to ask small people for payment/credit for using their creations, c) that small people would never have made significant money from their creations anyway so what's the point in them 'aggressively' chasing payment/credit from other struggling small people for use of their creations, and d) a feeling that small people allowing unrestricted/unpaid/uncredited use of other small peoples' creations is simply bros supporting bros and therefore it's 'mean' to seek credit/payment from other small folk, and anyone who does deserves to be ripped off.
.
So the issue isn't just that copyright laws are misunderstood: it's that they're fought against by people who either genuinely believe they are justice crusaders fighting some kind of good fight in circumstances that are unjust and unfair through no fault of their own, or who convince themselves that this is the situation and that this is what they are doing, as smokescreens for their consciences. For some, if they aren't aware of the copyright law, then as soon as they are made aware, they still have no regrets, and indeed start looking for loopholes or ways to kick against those laws with everything in them. Until doing that feels wrong and bad to the majority of people, copyright law will always feel unfair and broken, and will always be resisted by some. People often claim to want equal rules for all people, but often when it comes it it, what's really wanted is lenience in favour of the poor (or self-perceived/comparatively poor) at the expense of the (too) rich (or perceived/comparatively too rich in the eyes of those people). Once that is understood, the psychology of copyright law resistance can be treated, and that's where the root of the problem really lies.",0,2020-09-26T11:16:33Z

I think, the way it is used ""pop culture"" wise, isn't too bad tho. 
If you do not just put up the entire work or barley edited (just for the sake of having something edited) original in and also credit the artist everywhere you can  
- like in the video/post, in the description, and also how and where to support them, I think it should be fine. 
We could avoid big companies making use of this (and screwing individuals over) by making it a rule that only ""real"" people can make use of it. 
So no Big Name would be able to put a real person's content on tv without their consent.

I think it should also not even be considered a copyright situation - if you, for example, are just having a poster on your wall. 
You don't have to fill in a request for copyright use, when you have your family and frinds over either. 

The original idea of copyright has a good mind but the way it is made use of right now, is absolutely bonkers. 
Without pop culture I & many others wouldn't even know about most of these things, and therefore not making these artists any money.

1) The orphaned works problem is a real pity, _no_ _one_ benefits from that situation.  One
      class of proposed solutions that I like is to require copyright owners to pay a nominal
      fee or file a form perhaps every few years to keep a copyright in force.  If a work is in
      in active use, the copyright will be maintained.  If it is truly abandoned it will become public
2) Content ID is interesting.  This reminds me of patent pools, though not quite the same.
3) I agree that having a huge disconnect between the law and actual practise is an
    immense problem.  In effect, it gives enormous discretionary power to whoever has
    enough cash to hire tons of lawyers.  Not a good situation.  Regrettably, I doubt that this
    is going to get better during my lifetime.  The trend, in criminal law as well as IP law, has
    been in the opposite direction.",0,2020-09-08T05:20:01Z

The federation isn't communistic, except WRT the common incorrect definition of communism.  Two big hints, based on high school civics, are 1) There is a body which can be considered a government -- there is no gov't in communism because it ""fades away"" and 2) there are credits, a form of money, used to pay for things.  If there's no property ownership, there's no need for money.  I don't know about services, though. I must've skipped or been suspended on that day.
They seem to be a democratic (gov't) + 2 economic systems: capitalism + a social(istic) safety net. Everything you need to live a basically good life is provided: education, food, health care, shelter.  You then have the ability to further yourself.  IMO, providing those basics allows people to have better jobs and make more contributions to society, without worrying about just surviving.

But think about it this way. You get 50 years to earn money off of your work. 50 years from the day it's released (I would assume).
After those 50 years, people can use it to make their own things. I would honestly be excited to see what people will make of my music or my painting or whatever it is that I make. If you don't start painting in your 60s, if you start young enough, you can live to see people breathing new life into that thing you made 50 years ago. You can see other people's interpretations of it, see pieces of art born from your original creation, things you never ever thought of in the slightest. It would honestly bring a smile to my face to see anyone take my creation and make it into something of their own, put a completely different spin on it, breathe new lie into it in a way I could have never thought of. And I would not care at all that they are then making money off of what is essentially derived from my creation 50 years ago.
I'm not going to speak for anyone else. But I will say that I would not be surprised at all if many creators think similar to this.

.
I also agree on the main point of the ending. Copyright (and I'd add, patenting) is a mess. Even in and of itself it is questionable: a government-granted monopoly as a reward for innovation, is a monopoly nonetheless, and monopolies are easily misused. You make a very good point that it used to work (kinda) with big companies who can afford a legal team. And before that, it no doubt worked outright because the catalog was rather limited and lines were short.
.
But copyright doesn't work anymore. It stifles competition and innovation, and is just one of many avenues of eternal, ruinous lawsuits. When you need a lawyer to deal with it, as a regular person, the law is broken. And much of its application has nothing to do with its purpose.
.
From my understanding, in most media, the vast majority of sales are done in a matter of weeks. After that, anyone who wanted it, got it. Anyone who didn't yet get it, isn't willing or able to pay for it, so you won't miss any sales from them. Preventing them from copying your work (privately) does not benefit the copyright holder, and merely makes sure to deprive the poor from access to culture, prevents further innovation based on your idea,  and prevents your art from reaching a much larger audience. I see no benefit to this.
.
I dare say, the onus is on the copyright holders to explain why we should violate our core principles of freedom by granting them exclusivity, at all. There are cases where it's valuable. By all means, I don't want people profiting off ripping off someone else's work. Those who made it, deserve the paycheck. Perhaps use in formal publications should require permission, and commercial use should always be credited. But as a rule, it seems to me, you miss no sales, and society as a whole benefits, from most forms of copying. 
(and if someone gets DMCA''ed to shut up their criticism.. in my personal opinion, clear abuse of law to do harm upon others, is a crime against justice itself, and a hanging is in order ^_^)

33:50  Indefensible?  What are you going to attack with, ethics?  They have money, the courts, the media... give them an inch and a hundred years from now, no one will remember a time when fairy tales weren't owned by Disney.   (Or society will collapse.  One of those).

The current popular method of dealing with copyright law, just ignoring it and creating anyways, seems to be meeting with some success.  As evidenced by the fact that they can't keep up with removing, let alone punishing, all the violations.

Copyright law is fundamentally the partition of the commons of human creativity under corporate lordship.  Shackling art so that it can be cut up and sold back to the masses is the point.  This is why patents aren't as long - the capitalists already own the means of production, you can't compete with them.  While media can be complex, fundamentally its price of entry is lower: anyone can tell a story.  
Limiting the term of copyright only means that the media companies control 95% of culture, not 99%.  It is still the same, centralized and controlled.  Maybe you can, in theory, write your own Batman story.  But is it too close to the corporate version?  Does it interfere?  Did you, maybe, include ideas that are newer than 50 years?
Hell, to go to Disney's infamous Steamboat Willie - in 2024 it will, theoretically, enter the public domain (actually Disney will order Congress to extend the term of copyright, but let's pretend).  So, you, in your innocence, go to inflict your very own public-domain-Mickeys upon the world.  And promptly get the skin sued off your back.

My proposal:
For instances where there is a single author copyright lasts until death or 75 years after publication, whichever is longer and at least 20 years after a new work using that IP was made. (the work would have to be significantly altered so a re release probably wouldn't count, but I imagine something like a remix or directors cut could.)
For works by a corporation copyright lasts for 75 years after publication, whichever is longer and at least 20 years after a new work using that IP was made

This video to me echoes the misinformation (which was at the time mostly peddled by YouTube) around the EU's copyright directive, which seeks to solve exactly this issue by introducing a responsibility to negotiate license access on behalf of it's creators. This means that there is no longer the current level of power asymmetry that we are seeing with your proposed lawsuit/copyright strike issue. I wish people would pay more attention to it. This is not a matter of self regulation, and it is not an issue with the copyright system itself (that has existed long before lawyers and multinational organisations were seeking to vigorously enforce it) but it is a question of effective regulation which places a fair burden on those who profit the most.

Children have no control over their cultural environment - radio, television, fashion, advertisements, their parents' record collection - and it's inevitable that these influences will evoke nostalgia a couple of decades later. If you were exposed to media as a child, you were not giving any consent to consume the media on a trial basis... You were instead hearing it during a formative stage of your life, punctuated by accelerated learning. You of course have the right to remember the media. Upon adulthood, as memory fades, it should be your renewed right to revisit the media in all its forms (without the burden of its copyright), since it was - without your consent - a precious piece of your childhood.

20 years. I believe that creative works should enrich the public domain no later than 20 years from [evidence of] that work generating revenue for its copyright holder.

Ugy7T03U_7u9km76IwV4AaABAg,0.046,0.841,0.113,0.992,"I think that 20 Years (1 Generation) is a Fair Period for Copyright / Patent., at least as a Guarantee Period.
Remember that the point in Copyright Protection Law is to provide a Creator with an Exclusivity Period., where-in Competition is allowed on their Term & Conditions; and should they grant none, then obviously they retain said Exclusivity.

But beyond that, I think that it should be similar to Trademarks.
For those who are less well versed,. a Trademark is something that you Officially Register (for a Fee) that grants Exclusivity for 5 Years... this means that anyone who does use such within said Period without License is instantly in the Wrong; then beyond said Period you can either Renew the Trademark *or* alternatively you can Self-Protect., and this essentially means that you can either once again pay a fee (this is typically ¬£3,000 - 5,000) *or* whenever someone attempts to use it, you can defend the Right to said Trademark as a Brand Recognition in Court.
The thing is, you have to defend EVERY instance... otherwise allowances can be used as evidence that you're not defending it anymore and thus Public Domain.

Of course the frustrating thing is that once Public Domain, Trademarks can be registered by someone else.
It's a bit quirky... and far from ideal.
Copyright as it stands doesn't really work like this, but instead is always a Self-Protect situation; and again while sure, you have exclusivity Rights for Life + 70 Years., the reality is that if you don't Defend Copyright, then it can be de-facto Public Domain; and once ruled as such, you can no longer Copyright. 
This is a ""Good"" aspect of Copyright Law., but at the same time it does highly favour Larger Entities with Deeper Pockets; because they *can* Defend such.

Still consider for a second something like Fan Art of a Copywritten Character... let's say Master Chief from Halo. 
Technically speaking that's a breech of Copyright., but actually defending such would be nigh impossible (even for Microsoft / 343, who have insanely deep pockets) and more to the point it would be very back PR. 

This means that Fan Art is then De-Facto covered under ""Creative Commons""., and you'll notice many EULA and such will nowadays actually directly address such situations; as not to jeopardise the rest of their IP Copyright. 

Now, while 20 Years is arguable a ""Short"" Period... and likely never make it through courts without massive lobbying against such, primarily by Copyright Holder Interests (many are Investor Firms / Banks); what would be a better Solution is to take the Trademark Route., where Copyright was a Constant Renewal with a ""Lifetime"" Maximum.
So for example Copyright / Trademark / Patents could be held for 70 Years (Maximum) *but* in order to benefit from Copyright Protections, you would have to Produce something associative with the Copyright every 5 - 20 Years (dependant upon the specific Media being Copyrighted).

I also believe that Creative Commons (Fair Use and Practise) should be better defined., primarily this should be restricted to Non-Profit Endeavours with clear Exceptions.
Syndication for example could be clearly seen as a ""Renewal"" of Copyright.

See to me what we *realistically* need is a change in how Copyright works less so much in regards to Length per se., and more in regards to *ACTIVE* Usage. 
Copyright was initially intended to provide individuals with breathing room to actually produce / profit from their work without fear of a Competitor.
It's a reasonable goal., but I'd argue that today realistically Copyright itself needs to be more Clear Cut; with Preventions from Entities simply hording them... there MUST be an intention or effort of utilisation; otherwise it's not really achieving it's purpose to protect the Creator; as it isn't.",0,2020-07-21T20:12:08Z

There is no clear moral answer about who owns information once it is willingly shared with others. It is vital to pragmatically pursue a system that benefits society without blindly valuing the emotional attachments of a select few creators.

¬†The purpose of intellectual property protection is to incentivize the production of valuable information, and likewise the protection should only exist to the extent that it serves that goal. Protections extending beyond five years play some role in incentivizing production, but in most cases (especially art), these incentives are overshadowed by rent seeking and stifling the creativity of others. Rent seeking prevents innovation by allowing people to profit so much from earlier investments that it prevents them from creating new value.

¬†For art, providing financial incentive through copyright protection is of questionable value. The greatest art is driven by intrinsic motivation of the artist. Art driven purely by financial gain is typically of poorer quality. So we need to err towards enabling creators to produce whatever they like and not worry as much about money as we do in other fields.

Pokemon Sun/Moon sold 16.18 million copies, and that game also tried an entirely new set up. Following that, Ultra Sun/Moon which had very, very little in the way of difference, sold another 8.77 million copies. And Pokemon Sword/Shield sold 17.37 million copies. Consider the wide range of video games available to people today, I do not think it is streamers and youtubers that are to blame for revenue loss. It's too much saturation of the same things, and _critic_ of poor games being incredibly immediate, visual, and passionate. A video review of a top hyped game that just destroys it is going to do so much more damage than someone doing a let's play and enjoying it. Hell, it's not like Pokemon cares. They know they hooked enough of us at 12 that they are going to have us buying both versions of every core series game they put out until we die. 
It's when Mass Effect Andromedas and Anthems come out as rushed, garbage and get ripped to shreds and the companies can't trick people into buying their buggy ass, unfinished game for more than a week that loses them buyers, and future customers. But of course the idiots in the industry would rather blame people for playing their games online than making polished, finished games, and releasing them when they are actually finished, and not jumping on fads that will be over before the morons are even half way through their slapped together clone.

Also, the rules could possibly be made to apply differently based on the expected (and actual) success of the disputed content.

I think getting rid of the Twitch/YouTube streamer's ability to use gameplay footage would have a negative effect on game sales. Remember Funcoland? they used to allow you to try out games for free before you purchased them, to help make sure you were actually buying a game that fits your tastes, It's kinda like that. Not every game has free demos out there for you to try before you buy, and with games/consoles slowly getting more and more expensive I would probably stop buying new games if I didn't have somewhere to watch an example of gameplay.

Watching a movie via stream is much different than watching a game via stream. Watching a movie via stream gives me the feeling of ""already seen it, probably don't have to buy or rent that now"". That is a loss for the movie industry. With a Video game playthrough, every experience is just different enough to keep me intrigued, and make me want to try playing it myself. (Avengers movies will always be great, but no matter how many times you watch them, they are the same movie. Every time you watch or play minecraft it's a completely new/different world/experience to watch/playthrough).

So obviously Marvel (and other movie studios) should watch their product closely to make sure no one is broadcasting it for free without their permission, and Mojang/Microsoft should continue working with the MC community (because it's free advertising, and keeps their game soaring in popularity). I wish Nintendo would learn from Mojang/Microsoft (Nintendo has been known to harass creators from time to time, and has actually sued on multiple occasions, when instead they should capitalize on the popularity of their games, especially some of their old IP's which cost almost nothing to reproduce and sell digitally).",2,2020-07-06T10:52:06Z

The world has gotten so seemingly stupid that you can‚Äôt even play a video game without being striked for something that sounds nothing like music. You could literally go outside and record some sounds upload it on YouTube and find yourself with a copyright strike because some other guy recorded the same type of sounds and used it in a song which was then copyrighted. Music is a very dodgy industry with no stability and little credibility. Your success counts on being able to give your creations to music publishers to exploit you for a trashy business deal or for them to use your creations to sue or monetize from other peoples stuff that sounds just a little bit similar, and that‚Äôs down to an AI system to judge, makes no sense at all.

How shall I put this; if the original laws were actually good, I wouldn't have an issue with the US directly influencing so much of the world. That's why I like working democracies - if something is wrong, I can name the issue and try to change it through civil protest or by joining a party/ funding a new organisation, without getting into the details of it all; what I am saying is that as a citizen of the EU which is without a doubt the messiest big federal institution on the planet without actually being a normal government or fully democratic, it is STILL better for me than the US legal system because I am NOT a US citizen. The laws which are being talked about in this video influence my daily life and yet I can not influence them in any way. In summary, if you ever wanted to know why certain Europeans of smaller nations like my own country Germany have a problem with the unequal relationship between the US and its European allies and advocate for the EU despite knowing how many reforms are necessary to make this hybrid actually work, this right here is it. The US has every right to implement whatever laws they see fit and I have every right to fundamentally disagree with the idea of being ruled over by people and systems I can not influence. It's the same reason why I condemn China just a million times smaller because, despite all my criticism, the US is of course still fundamentally democratic and a close ally of my own national and supernational representation and especially as a German ( and a self-proclaimed European), I think it is the responsibility of old friends to look out for each other and to speak out when something is going wrong. 

America, I know we have shared a rough history in the last decades and what I said doesn't make this any easier but we still see you as allies and more importantly, as friends. Don't you ever forget that.",0,2020-07-04T17:52:06Z

Basically, what I'm saying is that copyright is long overdue for fundamental reform and we need to ensure that artists are able to eat regardless of whether someone uses their work in something else, but the same wealthy elites backing neoliberal capitalism are the people who keep extending copyright and actively shutting down any attempts at changing it, so we're probably never getting out of this without a fundamental shift in our economic order.",15,2020-07-02T06:11:59Z

Over 10 years ago my amateur photo, published on my own website (we had those in past decade), was used to illustrate an article by one of the largest news portals in my country. They just cut the picture so my signature was removed. I politely wrote them. I didn't want money or takedown, I just wished to be mentioned as an author. The response wasn't even in legalese. It wasn't in PR jargon. It was just ""you can sue us, sincerely..."" - in those exact words. Since then I had dozens of pictures stolen in less impressive fashion. I had a web design stolen. With an exception of one identity theft for dating site, all those infringements were intentional and corporate. I know a few content creators, mainly photographers and graphic designers, all of them have such stories. And there is even less defense against that than it is against copyright strikes.
I believe we need sth that will never happen, because of money: leveling of field. What UK did was a step in right direction, but it needs to go far deeper.

The vast majority of (at least indie) game devs actually seek out people to play and stream and make videos of their games. It's a dream come true for indies. Exposure absolutely does ""pay the rent"" -- without exposure you have nothing. Nobody will buy your game just by hearing the name. And nobody will not buy your game just because they saw a video. If somebody saw your video and chose not to buy the game, they are likely the same people that would have bought it, played an hour, and refunded it anyway.",2,2020-05-27T01:16:35Z

It's like using one sentence from a book. Not to mention that the company didn't put any work into the song to begin with. They just bought the rights so that they could then force others to pay them money, simply because they could get away with it.
And in regards to watching people play video games on Youtube, I have bought several games after watching someone play it on Youtube. In fact, the games I watched them play were games I'd never even heard of (or had literally zero interest in) prior to seeing the videos. So had it NOT been for the videos, I wouldn't have spent any money on those games at all (I got my friend to buy them, too). This includes Minecraft and Factorio, among others. So yes, the ""exposure"" does pay the bills sometimes. I have bought CDs after hearing the songs on the internet. I have bought movies/shows I loved after watching them in other places. If people like your stuff, they will be more willing to throw money at you. If you have to trick them into buying your thing because it doesn't have the muster to get them to buy it on its merits, then you've made a garbage thing.
I've watched the goose game, too. No, I never bought it. But seeing as how I'd never heard of it until watching the video, I wouldn't have bought it whether or not the video existed. And I'm not interested in it either way. Meaning they lost literally no money through the existence of the video, but have the potential to make more from the people that do buy it after seeing the video.

2. The Copyright Claim system. Like the content ID system, It gets abused to high-heaven every day, especially towards people that critique other people's work, something you feverishly preach yourself to be the main way of fair use in this video.

3. Youtube themselves and their complete lack of communication.

But they don't, unless it's something that becomes so large, they cannot possibly ignore it.

These assholes rule our lives - lawmakers - and it's a fantasy, it's unrealistic, to expect them to make things better. What's the point of government, and even civilisation as a whole, if it doesnt make life better? There's expressions saying things like ""the law's the law"" and in my country they say things like ""where's there s a law there's no negociatioin"" (could also translate as ""there's no arguing against the law""). So where there's unfairness were just supposed to suck it up? copyright is just one in a loooooong list of garbage we have to ingest daily from lawmakers and if one country is garbage many other will be if not all due to international treaties. What really is broken is politics and it needs to change. It takes an almost generational effort to force changes like shortening copyright. You shouldn't ever break the law, find ways around the law etc. but..... if law is unfairyou also can't change it? You need to campaign a lifetime for any small incremental improvement in law even when unfairness is OBVIOUS, aggregious and glairing? What needs to happen is rational people and people in good faith have to metaphorically stage a coup in every country in the world or at least in western countries. And also I may add those people should also love freedom and wherever there is doubt they should  err on the side of freedom. So for example on a complex issue like copyright.... wherever there's ambiguity, like songs on youtube or freedom of panorama etc. if ambiguity can't be resolved just default to no copyright and more freedom of creativity.",0,2020-05-05T13:24:47Z

UgzD3qg8oKPGGESlmoJ4AaABAg,0.08,0.793,0.127,0.9767,"The sad truth is that ENTIRE COPYRIGHT SYSTEM IS BASED ON A LIE AND IS NOW CRACKED AT ITS VERY CORE.

We are being told that if we come up with the idea then we own the idea just like one owns a car or a bike. THAT IS A LIE. An idea is no property. Because what if two people came up with the same idea at the same time? Legal system only allows one of them to own said idea - then the other is basically robbed of his property. That situation is impossible in case of owning a physical object because by default two people simply cannot buy one and the same car without knowing about it.

Hence why the very concept of ""owning"" an idea is fundamentally unjust. 

Also the reason why copyright law was introduced is because it was widely believed that if people cannot forever benefit from what they came up with then they would lose interest in innovation. But this mindset was proven wrong on many occasions. Biggest inventors were typically robbed of their inventions by clever bastards who knew their way around the law. Look no further than Nikola Tesla vs Thomas Edison. Actually copyright law doesn't encourage progress but hinders it. Progress is mostly ensured by freedom of taking other people's work and improve it, making it even better. But entire copyright and patent system makes it very, very difficult.

You claim that if small youtuber uses copyrighted content than ppl tend to just smile but if an international corporation used content from small youtuber than it would be a big deal. What absurd thing to claim! Small artists were robbed time and time again by the big players. There were many cases when big artists landed international hit songs and later it was revealed that big parts of said songs were copies of unknown artists' work. Nothing ever came out of it because a small artist is powerless against famous pop and rock stars protected by large international music studios.

Current copyright and patent law only protects large players leaving them completely in control as small artists simply can't afford the lawyers. The world however becomes more and more decentralized. Programmers no longer need international corporations to make server OS like GNU Linux or office software like LibreOffice. Many fan productions rival million dollar films in terms of quality.

A lot of great quality products, movies and music could be available if not for ancient copyright law that keeps small group of VIPs in position of power not allowing people with great a chance to compete.",0,2020-05-04T20:52:14Z

Copyright law is broken, and I'm all for a shorter duration.  50 or even 20 years sounds fine to me.  Make your money like you do when the work is fresh, then free it for others to use when it is no longer doing anything but making some company money on rights. 

One half-way measure might be to make a copyright valid for say 50 years, but allow a 25 year renewal if filed by the original author of the work.  this would allow those that actually do depend on some long ago work to get by to do so, or for the original creator to continue to profit from something that is still relevant or in high demand.",1,2020-04-30T22:36:36Z

Even fifty years is just ridiculous. Ridiculous. Pong, for fuck's sake, debuted less than 50 years ago. (Yes, I know Pong as such has essentially no copyrightable content in it.

There is a very good reason that intellectual property subject to patent is treated differently from copyrighted property: the scope of public benefit.

It is far more beneficial to allow patented property to enter the public domain, because there we're talking about life-saving cancer medication and other important technological innovations, which - if they enter the public domain - may be produced more cheaply and at a higher quality by new competitors in that industry exploiting returns to scale. On the balance of interests, it is far more important, as a benefit to society, to access cheaper and more affordable cancer medication - and to do so sooner - than it is to sample ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" by Mariah Carey without paying royalties. In terms of individual interests, it is far less important for the holder of a patent to continue doing so than it is for society to gain from the benefits that accrue from that patent entering the public domain. On the other hand, because the ratio of ""societal benefit to individual interest"" is substantially lower in art (and balances far more in favour of individual interest than is the case for patents) it should follow that the duration of the legally protected status of patents should be different from that of copyrighted property.",0,2020-04-28T21:30:16Z

Regarding the pixelated version of the Kind of Blue album cover... Fair Use actually has nothing to do with this. 

The new album cover is a derivative version of the original image. The original copyright owner owns the rights to how their original work is ""expressed"", and that includes the right to control creation & publication of new works which are derivative of the original.

Fair Use has nothing to do with it. Fair Use does not cover commercial usage. The pixelated album cover was created for the express purpose of making money. That is not Fair Use. 

Even if Fair Use was a reasonable argument, the Four Factor test would have come into consideration (nature of the original work, purpose of use, extent of the work which was used, effect on the copyright owner / market for the original work). Courts are very very reluctant to grant exemption under Fair Use - especially if they fail the purpose of use test.

But as I said, its not about Fair Use, its about the unlicenced use of a copyrighted property due to the new work being derivative of the original.

Also:
1. Fair Use is not an automatic exemption to copyright, it is an argument that can be made in court for possible exemption, and that argument must meet certain criteria.
2. Transformative in a legal sense means a lot more than simply changing something in some way. There are legal criteria which define what is and isn't transformative.",0,2020-04-28T03:29:26Z

I have seen MANY companies literally steal artwork, imagery and they will never get taken down, because they can pay for the cost whereas the person who would be making the claim can not.

Copy right itself is contentious to me to begin with. The idea of owning a concept or idea is really baffling and personally I think a lot of artistic work actually shouldn't be sold, but free if it's not commissioned but created through artistry to share with others.  But even if we're going to have a claim to none material things, then at least the fight between two parties should be won or lost not because of cost, but because the claim was or wasn't legally breaching.

Mostly because in cases like memes or YouTube creators it's practically impossible to enforce copywrite in the sort of scale that law calls for. As such we see inconsistent use of copywrite law and incorrect preceptions of how fair use works. To fit the sclae of the internet the law needs to account for the impossible nature of enforcing such types of laws in the scale that is grandscale shitposting.

You see, while one sub-category of content transformation is for criticism, there's also others. Some of those are parody, caricature and pastiche.


Those, within the EU at least and under certain conditions, are things that do not always require a license. 



I just wanted to clear that up.


But everything you say is also true: the copyright law itself isn't on track with public opinion. That doesn't mean that public opinion is always right, but that doesn't mean that the law is right either. On top of that though, something even more important to take into consideration is the fact that the catholic restrictions and exceptions we have for copyright do not work anymore in the form that they are. The world keeps on going forward, with more forms of entertainment being born every few years and with laws taking a long time to be modified for those things specifically. This is why we, for better or worse, we have many grey areas for many things, one of them being the emulation of video games, their preservation online and its connection and affiliation with piracy. 



In the world where the internet is truly powerful and where everyone has access to everything, the copyright law has restrictions which often do not take place and are dismissed completely. There's no proper security measures for copyright holders and it's confusing whether or not something is right or not. 



So, until someone does something about that and makes compromises that help people use content freely _under specific and correct restrictions_ AND help copyright holders not be in risk, this is always going to be a taboo situation.",1,2020-04-24T10:44:37Z

2. The creator of a work that is being critiqued claims the video and takes it down to silence valid criticism.
3. A troll/protestor claims a video to take it down because they think it would be funny, or because they disagree with the contents of the video.
4. A company strategically claims a video they do not own any content in, because it had better searchability than their video (SEGA did this to videos that beat their Sonic trailer a while ago)

No. At least, not in the United States. The framers of our constitution very clearly spelled out the purpose of copyright: 

""to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""

The point of copyright law is to enlarge the public domain over time. Exclusive control over a creative work is simply an incentive to encourage people to spend their time authoring and inventing, instead of (say) farming. The publication of new ideas is the goal, not the profit. After 14 years + a 14 year extension, that work can serve mankind best by living in the public domain, free for other authors and inventors to remix, improve, and enjoy.",268,2020-04-18T21:36:53Z

I tried to claim that it was no copyrighted because I was moving though a public area (was < 30 seconds a song because if you have been around there you know it's gone by the time you reach the next stall).   Anyways it was stolen by youtube and my whole 2 viewers were taken away.  I was showing pool tables in thialand.   I had no intention of on fringing on copyright.

I absolutely understand that, as a photographer, that I'd need a release from the song license-holders, the band members for the individual performance, and the venue for shooting footage inside of it. All of that makes sense to me. The thing I don't understand is why I can't privately hold a copy of the recordings which I took using my own equipment, on YouTube.
I receive copyright strikes and takedowns on videos that are not indexed and only have 3 views. 
I can do hardcore piracy in a third world nation that doesn't have copyright laws, FTP into my server, copy millions of dollars of stolen software to my PC, but because I'm Canadian and I'm not sharing the content, it's perfectly legal.

How do you think about the Fact that companies just randomly claim any kind of Music, wether it is actually there or not.
How do you think about the Fact that companies just randomly claim any kind of Music, even if the Music in question is evidently the property of the one they claimed it from.
How do you think about the fact that anyone can just claim the sound of a static, which anyone in the world can easily do themselves, and will probably sound the same, depending on what tutorial they followed to make it.

Those are facts, these things actually happen, that is what it means when something is broken, it can be effortlessly exploited.
And Content ID does.

And all those cases don¬¥t even have to bring any evidence, as long as a creator cant afford a Lawyer, they just stole easy money, and in my eyes Youtube is 100% complicit in this theft, and whats the craziest thing about this, they are appearently required to have the system as it is LEGALLY, as far as i know.

it¬¥s good that you look at other places for something to better. But saying it isn¬¥t broken, is just factually wrong.
There is no way it can be excused that Youtube is just going along with this, and i don¬¥t know about Murica, but Europe has recently decided to put a very, very controversial law, that basically prevents the spreading of any form of picture gif or othe sliver of any kind of media, thus crippling the ability to create ""meme-y"" content we currently all enjoy very much all over the internet.



I¬¥m willing to bet no creator is really able to create all those slivers of media/aquire them legally and NOT spend at least 100-200$ per video, and fair use becomes meaningless, because the moneygrabbing happens on a much more profound level, also they will then just simply be claimed again without the general ability for everyone to fight the claims without spending, whats probably another 200$ for a lawyer.

And the reason you were able to confidently use the clip of Untitled Goose Game is because showing a clip of a few seconds of a video game is not substantial, and the copyright owner has always allowed far more substantial gameplay footage in the past (including thousands of full playthroughs).

Edit: I've given your video during a coffee and the mandated CoVid-walk some more thought. I'm completely  unsure who your target audience is, it certainly is not the entitled zoomers.

German law for example does not know ""fair use"" or ""open domain"". Project Gutenberg is geoblocked there and so are most open library services. If I circumvent that is it piracy or a defiant act of freedom? Even instances of Creative Comons are subject to licence-trolls much like the patent-trolling that has been rampant for nearly a century now and could not be solved by ""international law"".
On a different aspect is ""ownership"" of software. There's a myrrhiad of smaller libraries of Abandonware, all of them are ""illegal"" and have been subject to lawsuits for the past decade. 

I think the problem lies in the total comodification that is Neo-Libralism and the solution is the total decomodification of any creative works, but lets face it, that would require a economy that is owned and operated by the worker.",1,2020-04-14T07:26:00Z

In a sense, it's free advertising for the game publisher and creators, at the same time, sure you can criticize and even falsely accuse the game of something it doesn't have, and in that case you-tube could step in and highlight a critic of that said person by either the publisher or the developer, similar to how there's banners for fact checking on certain videos like those containing COV19, the earth being a certain shape etc. I'd much rather a system like that rather than a full on legal action pursuit against creators who simply take footage of a game, even if it doesn't seem transformative, because people want to see the game. They want to know what it is, how it plays and if it's any good. The same thing ""could"" be applied to anything of course, and game developers and publishers do have their own rights, but it's not a question of when they do, but should they do it at all?

FWIW the chances that your suggestions will be adopted are zero. Hong Kong used to have a 10yr copyright limit which Disney et. al. protested and forced HK to bend the knee (this before reunification). The only real way to pressure the system to change is to make copyright unenforceable. It's already more convenient to download movies rather than use some DRM-infected streaming service.

A large creator with no violations in their new video got copyright claimed by a small account with no videos. YT gave the money earned through add revenue to the small account and even after correcting the false claim the small account got to keep the money and had no strikes against their channel.


YT is so geared against creators that even when you have all the legal rights it still screws you over and gives money to anyone making a claim. If the claimer is in the wrong no penalties.

you produce something and share online, if you're popular enought people are going to sponsor you.
wich also open doors for more creative oriented works of art.

In a discussion of fair use, they go through the four factors of fair use, but in the end, weighing purpose and market effect extra heavily, found that the defendants use of Star Wars GIFS to promote their Sabacc game without Lucasfilms permission was copyright infringement.

Imagine the legal headache if the copyright ran out for the founding work of an ongoing series of science fiction novels or films while the original author was still active. Tom is also selectively forgetting that educational works, like texts and audiovisual series are added to and supplemented over many decades by single authors as a life's work (especially in the case of university texts).That is not a small category of authors by any means.

I genuinely think that modern fan culture has been profoundly shaped by the absurd amount of lengthening that copyright law has gone through. For the majority of adults today, there is nothing that has been produced in their entire lifetime that is in the public domain, which means that there ends up being a very sharp delineation between what gets to be ""canon"" i.e. produced by the creators of the thing (very often, especially in recent years, massive publishing firms and megacorporations like Disney), and what is relegated to ""fanon"" (i.e. produced by the unwashed masses). That kind of sharp line between the two was likely much softer in the past, or maybe the concept of dividing the two wasn't even really a thing back in the days of, say, Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately I'm not a historian and I don't have the kind of knowledge, skill, or resources to do a deep dive on this stuff, but I would be really interested to learn about it.",0,2020-04-06T22:49:14Z

One thing I think Tom has not stressed enough is that Copyright Law was meant to give incentive to artist to increase artistic growth: before the invention of printed books, it was basically impossible to make money out of art unless you were commisioned something or paid to play live (or created a physical object that could be sold afterwards like a painting). When the possibility to make real money was widely available, a law was reqiured to prevent others from stealing their works and make money out of it, so that the artist would have the economic incentive in creating more and more. (And, just like youtube, at the beginning making money from writing a book was unthinkable). If the law instead does not allow you to create art, since 99% of the things you could do are copyright-strikable, or does not incentivize to create new things because you can just make money out of older things (Disney remakes do ring a bell?), it is not an incentive for artistic growth. It is a block for people who could have done something remarkable. 
This was more lengthy than I intended, but that is my point: we need more new art, and new art builds on (recent) art done by others. If that is illegal, art cannot grow adequately.",0,2020-04-04T10:47:13Z

I'm on the fence about copyright duration. 
I do think copyright is not just about making money from people using your work, It's also about control. If I create something, I want to have control over it, control over who can use it and how it can be used.

Imagine writing a song for, let's say, your dying parent. You publish the song, so other people in similar situations can relate and find comfort in it. That song will hold tremendous emotional and sentimental value for the rest of your life, beyond even, if you consider other people's feelings about it. And now imagine, 20 or 50 years later, copyright expires and it becomes public domain. At this point, anyone can take this cherished song and make some kind of a shitty remix, use it as background music in a video spreading a message you very much dislike, or it can end up being a part of some lame Tik Tok trend.

In such cases, I don't care about not making any money, I want to be able to say no to that. ""Keep your money, you're not using my song!"", know what I mean?

This was just one example but my point is, it's my creation, and I should be able to decide its fate.",1,2020-04-03T18:02:53Z

That could not be further from the truth. Game sales skyrocket when Streamers or Youtubers play these Games.

I doubt you would have ever heard of subliminal if youtube didnt exist for example.
Sure YOU didn't buy it - but that doesn't really say much.
I bought a lot of games just because I saw them on youtube and could make a save call
if I will like them or not. Sure I dont buy EVERY Game that I watch. 
But I still wouldn't do that if youtube or twitch did not exist.
I know that doesnt say much either, but sales figures do.

Eh, but maybe you just played devils advocate and it did go over my head.

Especially since it put such a complex issue in clear terms and made it incredibly understandable and informative. Now I am wondering whether it would be interesting and possible to make such a video on another current complex problem: streaming service exclusivity. With this I mean that certain services like netflix can own the right to distribute a product (movie) exclusively when they are not the owner of said product, but only licence it. I think It's an interesting issue since in 1948 there was a case (United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131) where the outcome was that Paramount could not limit the showing of its movies to theaters of choice, specifically theaters they owned. In my opinion this is a similar issue. Another related issue is game stores owning the rights to sell games they do not own; specifically steam vs epic. (these are just 2 examples of a multitude)

If a giant corporation thinks it is worth having a copyright last over 100 years, they can make it happen for a price.  Hopefully they will see this as being easier, less risky and cheaper than lobbying to block the change while still we otherwise get most of the benefits of shortening copyright.  So for a short time, you just have copyright by default without having to do anything.    To get it a bit longer, you have to register for a small fee which helps avoid orphan works, after that every time a work is about to expire it can be extended, but it ramps up until eventually it's not worth the expense and the work enters the public domain.  Yes, it's to the advantage of those with money, but they have that advantage whether we want them to or not.

In the US you have to apply for US copyright protection on any piece of work you do, whether it's a song, a video for youtube or a picture you drew, and it costs money, tons of money. You don't get copyright protections just because you claim its copyrighted when it's really not and you have not went through the proper channels through the government to apply for copyright protection.  Youtube gave everyone a false sense of security for some reason, on how they handle copyright claims. If you don't have a real copyright and the paperwork to back that claim up, then the only protection you have is Youtube honoring in good faith your false claim that you have a copyright on something.  Once you put something up on the internet, no matter which site you put it up on, it's in the public domain. You are giving your work to the world to use as they want if you have not protected your work with a real copyright through the US government. Youtube only takes down material when someone claims a copyright because it doesn't have time to check every claim, and that's where the abuse comes from. You make a video and upload it to your Youtube channel, and you don't get an actual copyright protection for it, anyone can now use that video or take that video and get a copyright for it, and once that happens they can legally profit off of it without worry of you, the original creator, of suing them because they now hold the copyright to something that you gave away to the public domain and there is nothing you can do about it.",0,2020-03-29T14:17:09Z

Mickey Mouse would be saved (since he's the corporate mascot and thus has a substantial amount of value to a massive company), smaller independent creators would have their works enter the Public Domain earlier, and older works that no longer have any significant historical or commercial value for the company that holds that copyright could simply be released once their original copyright expires.


The issue then is that we might see organizations like  ""Shakespeare Intellectual Property Ltd."" actually come into existence just to milk some works that were once significant pieces of pop culture for forever.

If someone streamed the game with the player not actively manipulating the controller or keyboard/mouse.... who would watch?  THAT would be just streaming the game.  But that's not what anyone ever does.  The performance of the players actions is not necessarily 'transformative' or whatnot, I'm not getting into that, but, it is an additional complication that would have to be factored in and balanced in any court review.  Then you have the fact that because of the very unwise way game publishers have chosen to conduct their business, the vast majority of streamers don't own their games.  They have a license to USE the game.  That will complicate things for the publishers if this ever gets to a courtroom.  They're not very specific (yet) about limiting or even defining what rights the licensee has or what obligations the publisher has.  Given how widespread streaming is, an argument that streaming your performance in the game is implicit in the granted license would, I think, have a good chance of a win.  IANAL.


A change to copyright law that I would personally very much like to see and which I think has proper protections for all involved would be an official legal definition of ""canon"" versus ""fan"" works.  Only the original creator would be authorized to create any ""canon"" works, and it would be illegal to label any fan creation as 'official' or otherwise intend to create the impression that it has the blessing of the original creator.  But, it would permit fan creations to use the characters, ideas, world, etc of a ""canon"" work.  When a person publishes something, their goal is to enter it into our culture.  When a thing becomes part of our culture, we have implicit rights.  These need to be protected by law.  One of those should be making up stories, fan fiction, using the same ideas and worlds and characters, with the understanding that nothing contained within is 'canon'.",0,2020-03-28T16:11:45Z

I mean people filing DMCA claims on content *they clearly do not own the rights to* for nefarious purposes, because YouTube's system does not handle this well. It also doesn't require the same diligence that the law requires in terms of consideration given to fair use. So there are now companies that exist solely to go around filing DMCA claims at anyone who includes the likeness of someone as a form of censoring criticism even if the likeness is an image or video that the person *does not have rights to* . This is not what DMCA is for, that's what a privacy complaint is for, but the DMCA is used because YouTube provides it as an automated way to ""take revenue from a popular creator, or remove a video you don't like."" That's not the purpose of DMCA, but that's what YouTube provides, which is strictly worse than DMCA and not in the spirit of copyright law.

It doesn't take the time to objectively discuss its morality and justification.

Just because its law isn't justification, a lot of dictatorships, monarchies, communist, and socialist countries have laws that are blatantly immoral.

As an example that would probably piss you off Tom Scott (The queen of England is essentially a tyrant who refuses to use her tyrant abilities) No society should have one person as the ultimate ruler (England is basically a socialist country which is just rolling the dice on each ruler for the eventual tyrant, its not a question on ""if"" a tyrant will rule England but ""when"". )  

As for America, any tyrant can be throw in jail and over thrown or simply not re elected next term.

So yea, you cant make a video explaining a bunch of different copyright laws and the shenanagins on how they work without objectively viewing them through a logical scope and a moral scope.

And the more and logical scope for me as a musician is, copyright law threatens my very ability to create and succeed in my career; its a hinderence and a menace. 

Id recommend if anyone ever reads this video that they look up Adam Neely's videos on music copyright to understand my views.",0,2020-03-28T08:32:55Z

People go to theme parks because it is something you have to participate in to get the full experience and I would argue it is the same with watching a video game recording vs playing it yourself. Media, such as shows and movies, are designed with no interaction in mind so the entire experience is simply just viewing it. An exception would be something like Black Mirror: Bandersnatch where viewer interaction is the defining component and the reason for it being such a big deal compared to the traditional movie/tv experience.

Also, the point about watching a video game to get the idea of it or to see how the story unfolds hindering the profitability of said game is ludicrous. If it wasn't for people playing games and uploading it online, giving these companies/people free advertisement, sales would decrease because the overall interest would be lower and a majority of sales for any given video game is highly reliant on interest alone. There are companies like Nintendo who will copyright strike gameplay because they want to curate who delivers these impressions onto others and is likely why there is a smaller amount of successful Nintendo fans that can sustain a Youtube channel by playing mostly Nintendo titles compared to companies like Activision-Blizzard who openly allow their content to be played by everyone on all the biggest platforms.",0,2020-03-27T20:51:48Z

Yes, it makes a lot of mistakes, but that‚Äôs inevitable, really, especially at this scale. My main problems are with the appeals process (which is generally opaque and often not done very well, frequently deferring to the claimant rather than the appellant, even for manual claims that are clearly fair use, public domain, or not owned by the claimant) and with the lack of consequences for obvious abuse (like allowing clearly public domain material such as white noise to be claimed without any consequences at all). There‚Äôs also the fact that, even if the claim gets overturned, any revenue during that period goes to the claimant (if they allowed ads but just wanted the revenue) and the YouTuber gets nothing for that time period. Similarly, I wouldn‚Äôt mind the copyright strikes system (since it‚Äôs mandated by the DMCA anyway) if there were consequences for making too many frivolous claims, but that‚Äôs a legal issue rather than a YouTube issue.

And that‚Äôs the key issue: ContendID isn‚Äôt the real problem; copyright law is. I also hate it when copyright maximalists use ContentID to either claim that US copyright law mandates filters or that upload filters can work and are feasible, both of which are untrue.",0,2020-03-27T17:21:40Z

The rules haven't changed, we just do them differently.

Content ID almost works. It would work with a very simple addition: If youtube would require a fee (similar to courts), if you loose a claim. That way companies would stop spamming claims (that are mostly against fair use) automatically, which is the real problem.
A company would not risk claiming 35 videos with 10 seconds of ""fair use"" regalated material in each (like a snippet of a song playing on a radio, when a person just wants to show that radio works), if  25 would dispute the claim. Even with just a fee of 10$, that would mean a loss of 250$ for the company.
And 250$ can not be that easily made back with the 10 remaining legit videos.
So those copyright claim companies would have to start using people who know what a legit claim is, instead of bots that should not exist. This is what breaks the system.

Another point is that quite many creations aren't made with copyright in mind; those shouldn't be copyrighted either. Patents have to be registered to be valid and that costs money.
You're right that 80s songs shouldn't be completely free for big corporations to get their hands on. On the other hand, copyright must expire somehow. I'd suggest a middle way: At some point (after 20 years) make it free for non commercial and non-profit use. Also, to get the expanded period, you need to register it and pay fees to the public and you'd need to provide the source material (source code for computer programs, notes and lyrics for songs, creation files for 3d rendering, whatever). Those would also be published and be public domain after the extended period. That way, the creator got a monopoly, but the public got the source that would otherwise probably be lost.
There could be another additional extended period where you'd not be able to prohibit someone from using your the work, but could get some monetary compensation. The amount of compensation (per user) would be proportional to the fee you pay to the government (representing the public); and even that only for commercial users. 

If you know patents, you'll find similarities. Those are intentional, not a coincidence. There's also differences. You need not protect your work from the public eye to be eligible to have it protected. There's no formal process evaluating whether it's profound enough the be copyrighted at all and many more.

And if it's so expensive to fight false claims, what stops wealthy people from just filing frivolous claims against people they know couldn't even pay to fight the blatant lie?
If I show a table I built myself, do I need a license for the paint I used unless I criticize it? You mentioned that quotes like lyrics from songs are copyrighted, so you can't speak them unless you're criticizing. Does that extend to brand names? The names of people? The statements of passersby? Turns of phrase and modern slang; memetic terminology? Are screenshots okay? Xbox, Playstation, and Steam all have built-in systems to take and share them.

How would it be if copyright was a gradual system? For example from the date of publishing to 5 years from it, you HAVE TO license it and pay whatever price the copyright OWNER asks for. From 5 to 10 years from date of publishing, the price for licensing reduces enormously and is not controlled by the owner anymore, rather another copyright institution, which somehow categorizes the work and licenses it for a flat fixed charge irrespective of what media company owned that work. After 10-20 years it should be CC license and after 50 years like you say, it should be public domain.

Creators need ""safe harbor"" rules (do this and you're 100% okay), ""verboten"" rules (do not do this), and everything else is ""iffy."" (Try to keep this last bin as small as possible).

Someone wold-famous, who's made hundreds of thousands or millions off of their music, are probably fine financially late in life. It was their primary occupation. But someone else just working out of their basement or private studio, only doing local shows, that work might be all they have, and cutting off the profitability at an arbitrary date is ending their pension or retirement. It'd be harder to implement a sliding scale, where total profit received from a work inversely determines its copyright expiration, but it'd be the only way to not screw low-profile or local musicians and creators. You could argue that Sonny Bono doesn't still need royalties from his performances or music, or The Who, or The Beatles, etc. But your neighbor who makes music in their spare time while also working a full-time job? That person deserves lifetime revenues, and so should their children, precisely because it's so much harder to give that work ""wings"".


Arbitrary limits the same for all works is exactly the mindset that created the problem you address: A big company with lawyers isn't the same as in individual or small team who can't. Treating all works identically while no matter who owns, produces, or uses them. A studio track cranked out by a massive record label where dozens of people worked on it and tens of millions are made is not at all the same thing as a one-person or small-team labor of love with no corporate backing. At the very least, corporate-owned media should be different than private-owned media. Twenty or fifty years might be a lifetime of profits for a work that hits the market with financial backing, but that might be the span of time someone had to put aside their work to raise a family for an individual. Maybe instead treat the copyright date as ""active"" *beginning* at a certain threshold of profitability?",0,2020-03-26T18:23:42Z

Nowadays, your video gets monetized by the copyright holders. I think, that's the best solution in this situation. 

However, we should really rethink copyright as a whole. Not only on youtube, but also on books, in scientific literature, in music, etc. My proposal: Make everything commons-free 20 years after its creation. We can negotiate up to 30 years if you want. And a fair use clause would be a nice addition for non-commerical users. But the current system (75 years after death of the author) is rubbish.

But I have to say, I disagree that copyright is too short - and I despise the comparison to patent law - which is totally incomparable! Parents protecting inventions are important to individuals to make money, but they simultaneously hold us back from technological progress. They make companies able to stop us advancing society, or, stagger their own advancements over the years which  oils otherwise be improving lives. Creative works aren‚Äôt the same. People love to use an example like Shakespeare because it‚Äôs so widely beloved and evokes the heartstrings... but unlike a patent: it‚Äôs not going to mean life or death, like advancements to a pacemaker might. At the end of the day, creative works are subjective. If they‚Äôre not able to be shared, society continues. And other creative works take the place. And we are not necessarily worse off. That‚Äôs an example of the ‚Äúseen vs the unseen.‚Äù Implying that we are a richer society for having copied and copied and copied Shakespeare - without knowledge of the wonder of creative works we could have had in society if we... didn‚Äôt copy; instead making new creative works. Perhaps better. Further, claims of content restrictions ignores the fact that having custodians of content ABLE to make the works into profitable industries (now and yes, into the future, and across generations) can help to PREVENT works from being ‚Äúorphaned.‚Äù It‚Äôs again, convenient to use Shakespeare as an example of where we don‚Äôt need this - but Shakespeare would be an exception. Perhaps other, lesser known works, could be much more popular today, if trust or company was able to market them, monetise them, and own them. But they can‚Äôt. So works languish. I couldn‚Äôt disagree more about shortening creative copyrights.",0,2020-03-26T13:09:25Z

They are doing kinda strange and very interesting things in order to modernize for the internet. So maybe they will strike onto something that can work. Sorry it got so long. 

While I agree with everything you say, your focus is on common law i.e. US and UK. Which is understandable since you are talking about Youtube's domestic laws and your own country. But the rest of Europe and other civil law countries mostly do it differently. Fair use is not the only way. As of lately, the EU puts a lot of focus on the question ""is this particular part of the work that has been used actually protected by copyright on it's own?"". The used part, when singled out from the whole work, has to be an ""authorial work"", meaning it has to be the result of the creator's free and creative choice in such a way that it is marked by the creators personality (paraphrased from case law such as Painer). That means that some forms of use might be allowed this way, before even doing exceptions. Now this way to do it is not perfect, and by IP traditions it doesn't really make sense, but it is, in my opinion, better than how the UK and US skips right to ""the entire work is copyrighted, thus using this 1 second part is infringement"". The EU way has the kind of nuance that copyright on the internet requires. 

They EU Court of Justice has also done some very interesting distinctions of when hyperlinked content is infringement and not. They look at whether the content is originally legally put online, and whether the person that linked it makes profit or not. It's been criticized for not making sense by traditional copyright and for being cumbersome, but at least they are trying to find solutions that can work on the internet and give memers and children some freedom while also making those that profit on other people's work pay up. 

And the EU operates with detailed rules about when use is fair, so it would not be impossible for the US and UK to be more specific with what is certainly allowed, if they weren't so stubborn on only using case law. For example people are allowed free private use, quotations, use in education, certain sermons, reviews and news. These categories still give some room for nuances while making the public better able to judge their actions against the law. The EU politicians consider this a key part of achieving the main goal that is to balance the authors fairly strong protection against the public interest of access and use. Because clarity in rules is important if you want people to follow them and think they are fair and legitimate (a major issue with copyright online). 

Also, the EU has actually done some work  to make orphan works archived, accessible, usable (but only for education and non-profit) and claimable by the right person. People don't love the system and they missed the part that gives the public access, but it's a start I guess. And it might lead to more in the future. 

There are also processes to achieve ""a digital single market"", and talks of ""a fifth freedom - movement of knowledge and innovation"", which both also will feed into the copyright modernizing strategies, and could potentially make some big changes. 

My point with these examples is that things can be done when there is political will to do so. And the EU is trying stuff. It's slow, it doesn't all work, but maybe some of it will. But I do not think the US will be leading this change, far from it. The legal reforms in the US are too heavily involved with economics, and the rich companies don't want copyright to change. And the US is the country that pushed for the 70 years after year of death, so we can clearly see what those in power want. 

I know it sounds as if I love the EU here and see no flaws, but that's not the case. I don't even want my country to join the EU. It's just that I've been studying this a lot lately and I find it all very interesting to compare the different ways of doing it all.",155,2020-03-26T01:54:58Z

UgzzjqAgnd7BW2tSCON4AaABAg,0.007,0.925,0.068,0.9839,"If it's in the digital medium; I could argue against the copyright claims. Regardless of the machine's architectures such as Intel, AMD, ARM, RISC, etc, regardless of the platform Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, etc., every single piece of a digital medium at its core is a set of sequences of binary digits. They are strings or vectors of various binary digits to represent either a number, a character or an instruction. Every string of binary digits can be converted from the binary number system to the decimal number system. So if we have a file that represents a graphical image that is, 800 x 600 pixels where each pixel has 4 color channels, RGBA plus some other metadata such as luminosity, saturation and other lighting effects which can be found in the header of the file before the raw binary data regardless of the contents of the file is compressed or encrypted, the file has a specific size in bytes which typically a byte is 8 bits. So if this file is 2MB in size we know that it will be approximately 16 million bits depending on the convention that is used for the representation of MB. So this file is one long continuous string of binary digits and we can perform a simple conversion of the binary value to a decimal value. The number would be quite large however, it's like saying I company X have copyrighted this number Y and anyone who uses Y without my permission will be sued without paying me royalties! Then it comes down to; can someone really copyright a number? Every single file on a computer system is an astronomical number! Even the operating system which contains many numbers is a set of numbers. Computers operate on electrical signals and the state of the current and voltages and we use them to represent numbers because a computer is basically just a finite state machine!  Now, if someone painted a picture onto a canvas by hand with some form of a pen or brush with actual ink, chalk, paint, etc. then that is an art and can be copyrighted. If a person wrote down the words to a poem or lyrics to a song on a piece of paper then that is an art and can be copyrighted, etc. yet when we move from the real world to the digital world via the use of machines, all of that art that is digitalized becomes one gigantic number, so how can a number again be copyrighted? That's like saying I want to copyright the function f(x) = x^2 and the numbers [-inf, +inf] and anyone who uses them must pay me! The reason I included the function because the algorithms or set of instructions that are used in creating software applications are just that, a set of functions! You can not copyright math! One can be given credit for it, but you can not own it! Now, as the hardware goes, yes they can be pattened since the physical design of the hardware is a unique device to other objects. I can agree to hardware patents, but I have issues with software copyright. Now when it comes to programs, it's a tricky subject because a program consists of many different algorithms and the question then becomes can a combined set of instructions or an algorithm be copyrighted? Well, let's use an analogy, if you buy a cookbook that has recipes for different dishes, those recipes are copyrighted and they are copyrightable, so in the sense of a specific algorithm being copyrighted, I can agree to that, however, once you apply or represent that pseudo algorithm into some programming language to become source code and another program compiles or interprets it into binary instructions, once again we are back to the fact that that algorithm is one large number! So the handwritten algorithm can be copyrighted without a doubt, but the virtual or digital representation of it being an astronomically large number can not! Now, if someone sent the source code of a program to a printer and printed out the source code to paper, then the printed version of that source code could then be copyrighted, but the virtual or numerical version of it can not! There is a thin line here, and how do we truly determine what is copyrightable and what isn't?",0,2020-03-26T01:48:47Z

This might seem like a weird analogy at the moment but that's only because music has been historically protected under copyright. There are plenty of games with a timing and accuracy that easily meet and sometimes even exceed the complexity of a classical pianist's performance (Beat Saber comes to mind) and there are plenty more games with a wide range of choices that mean that no two 'performances' come out identically giving each the unique character of the performer (Disco Elysium is one where the breadth of action makes it unlikely that two playthroughs will be alike). I love Tom Scott's videos but this seemed to be a bit too negative about gaming Youtubers - there are plenty of thoughtful and constructive game playing online twitch streamers and youtubers who are adding real value with their critique by exposing the strengths and weaknesses of the games through direct interaction. Would anybody argue that computer gaming magazines are breaking copyright by their reviews simply because all we get are screenshots?,0,2020-03-25T19:21:22Z

You need only look to all the art based unabashedly upon the works that entered the public domain, from Disney's Snow White to Cumberatchian Holmes.

On the topic of public domain compositions, they themselves are a bit of a minefield. If a transcriber has made modifications to the original music, their version of the sheet music might be a transformative/derivative work. Music books are copyrighted, how do you know that music you're playing of a composer that died two centuries ago is public domain?

Further I think when a creation becomes part of the public consciousness it should get some special legal status (details of which I have no clue about).

Then there are phenomena, such as Star Trek, that maybe could use a separate set of rules. For instance, I would be happy to see Star Trek get appropriated from its owners and controlled by a fan-run organisation.

How, and if, these changes should be made are moot points because these opinions are unpopular with the people who has money and power.

= $1600

Fujifilm X-T1

Lenses for the two cameras:
80mm = $1400

29mm Vintage lens = $200
Budget Zoom = $400

Filters: $500

Bags: $250


Macro-based accessories: $90

Studio Tripod: $400 + head: $200 = $600

Softboxes and various studio light: $800

Straps, various replacement parts and other knick nack: $200

Grand total: Roughly $8k - $9k

This doesnt include all the things but it gives you a fairly good idea of the cost of a BASIC loadout. A working pro would use all of this x2 for backup purposes. The cameras and lenses arent even close to the most expensive stuff out there and they are actually considered to be really cheap for the working professional segment they are in.

Add travel expenses, living costs, storage (I have about 10TB of harddrives which arent even close to enough) etc etc. Its an incredibly expensive profession depending on your work style and the clients you have.

They get a lump sum and move on. Artists and the like should get the same, but the problem is that their revenue stream is distributed. Physical media should always have a cost to it, but ""intellectual property"" needs to be limited.

To keep things short, labor should be compensated when employed to do so. Authorship attribution and acknowledgement should always be included with no time limitation. A short time (2-3 years maximum) should be allowed for select distributions to produce and sell. IP franchises should have 10-20 years of they are continually producing derivative works. Well known cultural phenomena that are not franchises should be public domain unless there is one of the aforementioned copyrights in place.

Creators don't deserve millions for a single work. They work hard like the rest of us and deserve a fair source of revenue for continued work like the rest of us. If you're a cultural influence, you should expect your work to be freely used by and adapted by that culture.",0,2020-03-24T23:41:58Z

Nobody ever sues to compel the infringer to put up disclaimers pointing to authors of stuff they had used, or to just replace it. 
How to make the copyright system better? You don't really need to change it in any significant way, just demolish the corporative hold on it. Take away the possibility of having copyright rights from companies. Destroy the ability to transfer the rights to your work to somebody else. What you made is yours, forever and unalienably Not the company you had worked for, not your children that didn't even existed when you had created this, _yours._ There's myriad options to allow other still use your work without them going ""Hey, _I'm_ the author and owner now.""Sadly we live in a world when media corporations have more income than the GDP of quite a lot of countries. So it's an already lost fight. They will bribe the politicians with millions of dollars (or, as the americants like to phrase it, ""lobby their interests"") to make sure they retain the hold on the souls of the creators.

Same thing when you talk about little creators stealing work from big creators vs. vice versa. You state that the former is sometimes let go, yet the latter isn't. But I don't think that's a reasonable argument: huge companies *constantly* steal the work of smaller creators - just usually in a different way (though sometimes in the exact same way... look up the case of the guy who did the music for the ""you wouldn't download a car"" advert). 



I suppose this whole video just isn't really up my alley, since I believe copyright in and of itself is an unjust crime. Any extended argument about how copyright / trademarks work without asking if it's actually just seems like very technocratic ""tinkering around the edges"" to me.

Ugye-BbusK25Ft6vZX14AaABAg,0.037,0.885,0.077,0.8871,"For what I know there are different copyrights for different things. With artworks, for example, there are copyrights of owning the physical object and the intellectual property right. Ideas are not copyrighted nor styles that are considered generic like stick figures. Collage is quite a grey area. So I would assume music and videos works differently. 
Personally, I make art but don't necessarily make money out of it so if in 50 years I still own the original and can't sell it because someone decided to reproduce it as prints, then they make money and I don't. Nowadays, people believe art is free and it's one of the reasons why it is increasingly hard to earn money from it. Why would they pay when they can just take a screenshot and print it? So as an artist, either you show your art (via social media platforms) and risk constant theft regardless of making a living out of it, or you don't show it.
Hence, maybe your idea of 50 years copyright should only apply if the artwork has been sold?

Perhaps, another idea would be to leave the choice to the artist. Every artist has different things they are okay with so maybe instead of a one rule fits all, there could be like 'packages' options. With that, the consensus would be that you cannot assume and have to ask or check with the artist's copyrights descriptions to see if your intent would be legal or not.

UgyR_5kh3YrUTULjuRZ4AaABAg,0.007,0.795,0.198,0.9973,"I do think a reduction of copyrights is reasonable, but at the same time, I think it's fair for one to want to and have the right to leave their works as an inheritance to their children. Not all works make a lot of money while the author is still young, one can sometimes only start to reap the profits later on, and with a within-lifetime expire, big corps would potentially make more use of it, like having people scanning for potential new blockbusters that expired just now. Then you're in your 50s or 60s and all of a sudden you're kind of like the new Stephen King or George RR Martin, but instead it's credited as Disney's or Michael Bay Jr.'s or something. 

Similarly, you could have not have made so much to leave a meaningful inheritance, but then richer people start to reap larger profits out of your work, and none of it goes to your loved ones who survived you. While this is not something that would make many people give up creating any work at all, it should already factor in how much time they invest in it, and it definitely doesn't seem quite fair to me.

I think it actually has an opposite effect on the incentive to create original works, to limit more the copyrights' lifespan, than patents. With patents usually, you have more often a situation where a new solution wouldn't be tremendously different from a previous one, so that it would be copied and that there would be competition on production and delivery is more of a social gain. Whereas if one can just rehash intellectual/artistic works, the path of less effort is usually the path more often taken, and the nearly only ones gaining from that are those who copied and had more resources to invest in someone else's creation. Maybe there could be things like, if you have a free-for-educational-purposes license, your copyrights last longer, whereas if you chose a I-want-every-penny-from-childcare-and-non-profit-schools type of deal, your copyrights are shorter.",0,2020-03-24T20:45:48Z

There's a big difference between watching someone play a game and watching someone watch a movie. because for a movie, the watching of it is the whole thing. there's not a fundamental part of the experience that you're missing by watching someone else do it. it's just a movie with added commentary. but for a game, there's a whole other part of it, that's reacting on time, making quick decisions, exploration, just the whole control aspect, that's not present when watching someone play. It's more like watching a cooking show. It's entertaining but it's not a substitute for doing it yourself. it fulfills a different need. it's for when you sort of want to do a thing but you don't have the energy, or for when you are doing a thing and you want company (i watched so many sims videos when i was playing the sims), or for when you want inspiration for things you will do in the future.",0,2020-03-24T18:08:22Z

But why should the age of the work be the determining factor? This entire discussion is, at its core, a question of how much profit is too much. Why not make copyright apply for as long as a work has generated less than ten thousand dollars (or an equivalent amount taking into account inflation, and obviously differing but similarly-culturally-significant amounts in other currencies) in profit for any persons or organizations who have held the rights to the work? In order to prove infringement, a claimant would need to prove that the total profit from the work is under the threshold. Yes, that would require effort, presumably mostly in recordkeeping. But I'm not sure it's any more effort than is required to prove infringement now. I'm also not sure if it's any less or the same, someone would probably need to do a feasibility study.

I'm of the opinion that profit is a harmful concept, and thus copyright is a harmful concept, and thus neither should exist, and from each according to their ability to each according to their needs, yadda yadda yadda. But I recognize the necessity of copyright to get something resembling fairness in our capitalist, profit-driven world.

Youtube does have a copyright system, and although parts of it do work, other parts are definitely broken. That  three strikes policy is far more insidious than this video claims. If you use someone else's material when you shouldn't, your video should definitely be demonitised. If you believe you are in the right and dispute three of those claims, your entire channel is demonetised until the conflict is resolved. And getting your money back for that period? Good luck.


Also, copyright law is not the reason James Bond movies aren't being made by anyone else. It's trademark law, and I don't really have a problem with that.

As far as I can tell your only point is people that don't uphold the law could get sued. Color me suprised, what a revelation.
While most people may fail to articulate their criticisms properly when outrage about copyright law happens, it is still clear the the frustration comes from how outdated and infunctional the law is when it comes to the internet. (Or copyright in general, the concept has become an enormous monstrosity thanks to lobbying from Disney and should be overhauled)


I will concede that I will stop watching this video at the 20 minute mark, as so far I have not learned a thing and my time feels wasted.

Anyway, the 21st century calls for a revision of old copyright laws in order to better discern who is at fault while leaving a bit of leeway for entertainment purposes.

UgxpFe-3rY8-T6TTwsN4AaABAg,0.037,0.811,0.152,0.9704,"Well, you're not wrong. There is a fairly strong case to be made that all IP law is morally wrong, and frankly the historical precedents regarding IP law,especially copyright, are particularly horrible. In short, current IP law is a blunt instrument that was created to serve a very narrow range of interests (and historically speak, *not* that of the creators). The rise of a truly global community and economy through the widespread deployment of the internet has only exacerbated those problems. 

YT & FB are effectively the court system for this new constituency and they are essentially tyrannical and opaque. I agree with you that they are merely responding to regulatory pressures from the legal entities which have granted their articles of incorporation. That doesn't change the fact that they function as a legal system unto themselves. Given that law is a combination of explicitly codified and customary behavior (as should be obvious to anyone living under a common-law system), I do feel that there is a certain burden of reformation on the publishing platforms as well. And handling the moral ambiguities of copyright is actual an ideal place for common-law solutions. 

Sadly, it seems that the platform corporations have little desire to use their deep financial power to support the creators who contribute to their success. Because they certainly *do* have enough financial power to bring lawsuit against Disney, UMG, and others like them in order to encourage creativity and regulate the apportionment of revenue from different uses of pre-existing content. But the platforms have essentially aligned themselves with the publishers who created copyright to protect their investment in printing presses.

I feel that the worst part of youtube's content ID system is that it adds insult to injury:  someone fairly uses portions of a work, and then it not only permits people to file false claims, but it financially rewards them for doing so even if the claim will be contested and they will be forced to give it up. Particularly in cases of CLEAR fair use. 


Really, if they just kept the money until the claim was resolved, and then shipped it to the prevailing party, it would feel vastly less abuseable. Is that in some way illegal? can Youtube  not legally delay payment of ad revenue until they know who should get it?",0,2020-03-24T11:03:50Z

But even if it is someone uploading or using a recording it is absolutely infuriating, especially since YouTube does not offer an option to refute this claim (the only option is to say: All content is mine). If you are using some recording, you might well be okay with the label taking some revenue, but you surely are not wanting some completely unrelated label profiting from this, because they have a recording of the same piece in the CID database.
This get‚Äôs even worse when live broadcasts of concerts are put on YouTube by an Orchestra, an organizer or some radio channel, and you get a f***ing claim for using some recording.
And then there‚Äôs the thing with old recordings, that do not have property rights anymore. You basically can legally do anything with such recordings, as long as the compositions are in public domain. But then you get things like Naxos who transfer old recordings, and since those are then in the ContentID database, YouTube will assume that Naxos has the rights to this recording.

I can't wait for this to inevitably be taken into small snip-bits and used by someone who doesn't know what the hell they are using, but just see a quick opportunity for money. The fallout from that should be interesting to follow from the sideline, but that has nothing to do with this.

Applying the same thought process I can argue the opposite because the same videos regarding ""Untitled Goose Game"" made me go out and buy it.

And yes the YouTube's content ID system is a shambles. ""That's the way it is"" is not an acceptable state of existence. YouTube doesn't host for free, they make money from your original content. It's a quid pro quo between YouTube and the content creator. Updating the law internationally is absolutely needed to re-balance things in favor of the individual creator, not the corporation. An individual should hold copyright on original works for their lifetime plus 10 years. The remaining corporate copyright mess is a bit of an odd animal, however, I'd spit ball that at 50 years and then it falls into public domain. And for corporate created content, extensive fair use should apply even while it's under that 50 year copyright.

imo copyright should be way shorter then now (50y is a good base) but if you continue to add to your story, your copyright gets extended (but at the same time i see how that can easily be abused and lead to a whole lot of useless filler content, and i think there should be a way to combat that as well, but im no legal expert, so i dont know how that would be done)

Some creators and copyright holders (notably most of  those that talk about 'intellectual property' in a non-sarcastic manner) seem to want copyright to be indefinite (which... Would be very damaging)
But we're already at term lengths so long that it might as well be indefinite for all practical purposes.


Because of that, the very idea of 'public domain' has largely lost it's meaning in any realistic sense.
And copyright laws don't serve their original intended purpose when copyright lasts a VERY long time.


What little research there is on the subject of how long copyright protection should last given that original intent...
Well, it points to several issues;
- Firstly, within the margin of error for the research done, copyright terms should last no longer than 35 years, and may need to be as short as 7 years to have the original intended effect.
- Secondly, and more problematically, how long copyright protection lasts should be getting SHORTER over time, as more copyrighted works come into existence... (as, in a strict sense, the more works exist, the less value each has individually)


Trouble is, of course, that lobbying tends to have the opposite effect. Copyright terms keep being extended, and once they are a particular length, undoing it and going back to a shorter length appears nigh impossible.


A LOT of the most egregious problems we are currently facing would largely go away if copyright terms could go back to being maybe a decade or two, not measurable in more than a century...


But alas, the odds of that happening, given that the changes to the law over time have all seemingly gone in the opposite direction?
Well, that's just not very likely is it?
And it doesn't help that the primary beneficiaries of the current system are not individual creators, but large media conglomerates whose primary interest is gaining the rights to as many things as they possibly can...",1,2020-03-24T05:15:44Z

I think copyright should last forever.

No, no, wait; I think you should get either 7 or 14 years from publication, and you should be able -- if you so desire -- to renew it for a like period forever... with the payment of a nominal fee, maybe $50.  Perhaps that fee should be proportional to how much you've made exploiting it, I dunno.

But I think that once you don't care anymore, it should lapse.

I'm aware that this view won't be that popular amongst rightsholders... and I know that because I suggested it to the literary agent for SF author Robert A Heinlein at a convention 13 years ago, and I nearly gave the poor lady, then in her 70s, a stroke.  But I think it's in keeping with the goal for copyright, listed in the Constitution: to *promote* the arts.

What we have certainly doesn't.

I believe intelectual property should fall under a whole new paradigm
Something that allows people to also profit from the works of Harry Potter or even yours without ripping you off, to make small creators be able to try to compete with big corporations or at least get some money under it
The main problem right now is that the only players allowed to dispute are the ones with money
If we could track the author (Wich can be hard, imagine that an important photographer took a picture of a star wars movie, you took a photography of that photography and shared, who is the author?) And took a fair share of any profit made under his work
Maybe a quarter of it? Maybe half?
The world has forever lived with the copy of other people's work, be it for educational purposes or to profit of it

But now, you might have have a big corporation messing with small creators or literally copying a small Japanese movie that no one knows of and it becomes the original for us westerns and they resolve it without much problem for the big studio, because it's cheaper
Even patent are quite abusive and there are plenty of terror histories of big companies sueing people to poverty even tho they stole their work

For me, credit should be the most important currency
With that credit your fair share is also included
If you don't credit it, you get problems, it will take power out of big companies, they will have to credit your work and pay your fair share
Whatever solution, the weakest link in the chain shouldn't be the one giving up because it's easier for them, if anyone, it should be the big corporation",0,2020-03-24T02:39:11Z

I would suggest base copyright of 5-10 years. which can be extended to say 50 years with registration for a small fee at any time before the unregistered copyright expires. registration is contingent on maintaining current contact details and continuing to make the work available in either its original state or a more accessible state (a NES game could be delivered as a digital rom instead of a cartridge if the copyright holder wanted) at some reasonable price (eg no more expensive than original retail + inflation). 


modifications to allow the work to be accessed (eg edit the old game to work on a modern computer, console emulators, transfer film to disk) would be considered fair use where there is no reasonable way to access the media without such modification.

Had lead to people getting expelled. Even if the economic hard to the copyright holders where basically nil. So one got a bit paranoid about using someone else's work.

But we skipped on any form of illustrations (though was less relevant to the paper I was working on, but more relevant to a group of students I was helping with there academic paper).

Another one (Street French) got their video demonetised because they mentioned COVID-19, and in YouTube's opinion, earning ad revenue from a video COVID-19 is somehow akin to profiting off people's deaths?

I suppose that isn't a copyright claim, though.

So yes, Tom, while I agree that a lot of people on YouTube use ignorance as an excuse to violate the law, the problem isn't so much what happens to people who are actually breaking copyright.

Ugx-L2TSKl_r46WnLT54AaABAg,0.124,0.748,0.128,-0.5239,"So in essence,  YouTube's copyright system isn't perfect, but although it may do wrong for some, it'll do right for others.  I mostly agree with this sentiment because a lot of people fail to look at things objectively, and that's a major issue in society as a whole in today's world. There are way too many people who will do a number of things, either they'll fail to admit they're wrong (so few do) because who wants to say that they were in the wrong? Or they'll fail to research, taking the word of someone else from YouTube saying the same thing which could be misinformation, or them receiving it all wrong.  Or they'll blindly follow what others say, which is just a combination of both things said previously, but this can be with viewers on YouTubers they support. 


What we should make sure to do in everything relating to legality when posting (or watching) videos look at it objectively. Look it as though you don't have any affiliations with that video, that channel, only caring to see if this video is breaking copyright laws. You can then use that argument when facing a challenge against a copyright strike, but even throughout such, you have to be willing to accept that you may be wrong. The system is in place to protect people against actual people stealing content from hardworking people that may have had months, maybe years, as well as possibly lots of money put into that content. 


The area I slightly disagree with is saying that YouTube's Copyright system isn't broken, because it slightly is. If something is broken, that implies that it is not working in its peak whole form and with a case like yours, as well as other YouTubers who've put absolutely no copyrighted content (like TheFatRat with him putting all of HIS own music in it). I suppose to say something is broken is more subjective then it is by the fact such. A cup that has been chipped may not be broken to you, but it could be considered broken by someone else. A car with major dents may be broken to you, but to someone else, they may think otherwise. But due to the cases that both you and I have explained, I still believe that it is broken.",0,2020-03-24T02:04:58Z

1. I feel like the UN should work together to form new copyright laws internationally. Considering small creators, large companies, and everything in-between. 
Obviously, this isn't very feasible, that would be MASSIVELY expensive, and there are other, more important things going on in the world than copyright. But in an ideal world, that is what I would like to see. A new, built from the ground-up UN enforced copyright system, for all countries in the UN.

2. Smaller businesses should be given some sort of compensation to go up against larger businesses. 
I don't know if this applies outside of Australia, or if I've been taught an over-simplified version of it, but in business class, we've been taught there are 5 kinds of businesses. Sole trader, Partnership, Private Limited Companies, Public Listed Companies, and social enterprises. If a Sole Trader or Partnership goes up against, say, Disney in court, that is extremely unfair. How can the correct outcome be met, and justice upheld, if Disney is gonna have WAY better lawyers? On top of that, I don't think it's particularly fair for social enterprises to be affected by copyright law, as they aren't even looking to make a profit (I don't know if there are already laws around this, I'm just splurging out my opinions into a youtube comment). 
Now, this still creates issues for youtube. Who is the business? Is it youtube themselves, or the actual content creators? Or is it some sort of a mixture of the two? But I think someone smarter than me could probably clear that up.

I probably just said a lot of really stupid stuff, so go ahead and lay into me. I'd rather get cleared up on how this actually works than remain ignorant.",0,2020-03-24T01:42:07Z

I'd shorten copyright back down to 20-30 years but then allow companies to pay to extend it.  In horse racing they have races where to try to make them more fair all the horses are for sale at the same price.  This keeps people from entering horses that are much better than the field.  Modify this for copyrights- when the copyright expires the owner submits a paper saying 'this is what this copyright is worth'.  They pay a tax based on what they set the value at, say 4% (you'd have to play with the number but something less than what you'd expect to make as profit on it.)  The catch would be that anyone else could match that price and buy the copyright.  At that point the original owner would have two options- release it into public domain or accept the bid and take the money.  Presumably, at this point most stuff that doesn't have a high commercial value would pass into the public domain.  Things with high commercial values would generate tax revenue.  That revenue could be used to help subsidize streaming services so that people have access to the stuff that is still copyrighted.  The streaming services, wanting people to pick their service, try to pay people who own copyrights the best stuff, helping people make more money on their copyrights during that initial period.

I'd change the start date of copyright to whichever is the later of the two- either the date of creation, or the date of commercialization.  If you have a lyric you wrote in high school but it has been sitting in a notebook for 20 years and you finally record it and start making money on it the clock shouldn't have started running before it was commercial.  Performers would always retain the right to perform and record their works, even if they were bought out under the bid system, although they couldn't transfer those rights to others, and of course whoever bought the rights could use them as well.

How do you attack it politically?  I call this the Hong Kong solution.  You but the date out in the future.  It's not ideal but it will help people plan.  Pick a date, say 70 years from now.  All copyrights collapse in on that point.  In 2090 all copyrights follow the new rule and as we get closer to 2090 copyrights get shorter and shorter.  Say we go with 25 years.  You create two works, Work A in 2062 and Work B in 2075.  The copyright deadline is 2090... so you get to use the current system until then.  In 2087 the copyright doesn't expire at 25 because it was still under the old system, but when 2090 rolls around it is now under the new system and it expires (since it is more than 25 years old).  You can extend it using the system of submitting a value and paying a tax on it.  Work B is only 15 years old, so you have 10 years before you have to deal with it's copyright expiring.  If that is too long you could collapse it faster, say at a 2 years/year rate, although you need to tweak the formula to maybe use an average age of someone instead of the age they die at.  That's a sort of weird rule anyway.  Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain... their stuff has a much shorter copyright than George Burns... set it to 75 years and then collapse it from there.

If the tax rate is set right it encourages large amounts of material into the public domain every year but companies like Disney who rely on Mickey Mouse have a way to keep the stuff they are still using.  If you don't like the idea of companies being able to extend indefinitely set it so that they can never, adjusted for inflation, lower the value and bump the rate of tax they pay on it up by 1% ever five years.",0,2020-03-24T01:10:04Z

UgxqQRvV8CdXEBl8NBV4AaABAg,0.067,0.801,0.132,0.9868,"I'm studying music. I have a very liberal preference for copyright. I think the idea (at least in music since it's the only place I have any qualification) of actual ownership died with the introduction of file sharing. Fundamentally if people want to listen to my music for free, they will listen to it for free. The only exceptions I find to this are artists whose music has been lost in nearly every avenue. But that's not money to the artist. That's generally money to whoever actually kept that CD or Tape from that busker or local festival.

I don't think it's reasonable for me as an aspiring musician to ever expect to make money on people just listening. In a way, it feels like all musicians have become buskers, at least those of us without a label, (and I'm not here to bash labels and how they treat their artists I'm talking about copyright damn it.) Merchandise, concerts, and donations, these are what makes money for a musician. The music is free, it's out there, I can fight it or I can accept it. I don't want to fight it.

Maybe it's because I grew up listening to music from Limewire, watching movies on putlocker, fandubbed anime, and Tumblrs filled with reblogged memes and images from OPs that didn't create them. I made AMVs, they're on this channel.  I certainly know they aren't defendable under fair use, but I mean what does transformative even mean? I know I don't own the song or video clips but I put hours into each video. I went to 2 years of film school. I spent over $1300 on a Mac with the software I had been trained on. I'm not expecting to make money on these, not that I get the views for that, but I'd be hard-pressed to believe that's stealing. A song I have written and recorded being used in an AMV would be amazing, I'm definitely not popular enough for that, but also it would no longer be just about my song. People would watch that AMV who never would've listened to my song, who would've never heard of me.

I feel primarily concerned about copyrights effect on the ability of people to engage with art. Maybe it's because I'm too utopian socialist, but I don't think art is really worth it if it can't be engaged with, covered, used in original music videos, memed. 

Even though most of my professors support a stronger copyright position than I do, we're being taught that we will not make money on copyright.

I'm glad you put the time in to make a 42 minute video, because it's 4am where I am and I can't make my thoughts coherent, but I will just leave it as is for now. Enjoy my strea of consciousness..",0,2020-03-24T00:50:03Z

Rights to recordings cannot be sold, but they can be leased. In the contract you have to specify the number of years and it can't be greater than say 20 years. If the contract expires before the performer's death, the rights revert to the performer otherwise they become public domain. So even if the original artist is saying no or asking for a lot of money. If it's been 20 years, then you can perform the song, or find pay someone to perform it or find someone that has performed it and will licence it for something reasonable. Seems like a good compromise. Not sure how to handle groups of artists like bands though. It also doesn't handle people being paid to perform by a corp, and the corp get's the rights. Now there's no ""lifetime"" to limit it.


I'd also be ok with ""lifetime"" rights agreements. In this case the original creator can agree to exclusively renew the rights to a specific party (so they can get a bigger lump sum than just a single 20 year contract.) In this case, the next contract in a set of  predetermined 20 year contracts kick in immediately after the previous one expires.. so long as the original creator and the other party (person or corp)  are both still alive/not defunct.

Obviously, these goals run directly counter to each other. Importantly, they are also the shared purpose and philsophy of their respective fields, meaning the people doing them.  Those people pursue their philosophy not just for themselves, but in the public space and so they necessarily meet, overlap and clash. Your claim on your own video was easy to protect, because it dealt with something the law and technology are much better at than policing ideas; they dealt with your *stuff* : your images, sound, etc. compiled in your video. Again, the *clarity* of those facts made it easy to deal with; a whole host of precise properties only your video had, making it detectable and usable as evidence. Had they recreated your video, it likely wouldn¬¥t have been detected automatically and it would have been harder to use as evidence. If you tell someone about an idea for a video you want to make and they make it without your involvement it would be close to impossible to prove that. If you inspire someone to make a piece of art by telling them of a vague sense of wonder you feel being at a certain real world place, that work is legally not yours at all.

I would say, if a YouTuber has consistently shown to understand and adhere to fair use, it is extremely unethical for YouTube to still automatically assume it is infringement and hand over 95% of the profits to the company.

There's two ways I can think of to fix this, and I think they should both be implemented.  One, reviewers who consistently win appeals should not be flagged automatically.  Two, upon a won appeal, YouTube should retroactively give the profits to the YouTuber.  YouTube can then easily get their money back from the copyright holder by withholding some of the ad revenue that they get from other sources.",0,2020-03-23T23:01:06Z

Being that a piano sonata from Beethoven, or a violin concerto by Tchaikovsky has been recorded thousands of times, it is inevitable that some seconds of your own performance have similarity to 1 or more recordings. Then, you automatically get a claim (or more) and some random Polish recording company get to place advertisements on your videos.

Once you cycle through your videos and find a claim,  you disputed and 1 month later it is removed but, by then, another of your performances has been claimed... It is stressing.

It is usual to find a video of an elder pianist sharing his performance of a classical piece, and see that it has been claimed multiple times. It gets ridiculous to the point that in the description of the video, shows the content to be from multiple pianists across different ages, nationalities and recording houses.

Yes, people have a right to their works. I don't care how wealthy the creator is, if you want to talk about rights, it is infinitely hypocritical to say you have to right to copy someones hard work with minimal effort, then only to say they are bastards for claiming what is rightfully theirs. Tom avoided saying outright this whether this was immoral, but I staunchly say it is.



Yes, the great expense ANY of us face in suits of Common Law in the US (and worldwide) is steep and terrible, and deserves reform, especially in the case of individuals who struggle fiercely to pay, but means are not ends. The means need reform, but in the end, they worked hard. It belongs to them. Put in the same tough work if you want to claim the same rights. 



It is wrong to entitle yourself to someone else's property. Don't complain if they are ever so slightly upset by that. Claiming someone else's stuff makes you the bad guy, not them.",0,2020-03-23T22:06:03Z

I've only made it 19 minutes in (exactly, amusingly enough), and I have to take a break.

Where I'm going to take my break, though, is on your observation about ""horrible gamer children thinking something is their right"".

Copyright is not -- and has not been for 4 decades or more at least -- what the Constitution defined it to be.  The Sonny-Bono-Skied-Into-A-Tree Copyright Term Extension Act (aka the Disney doesn't wanna give up Mickey Mouse Act) is the biggest contributor to that, but not the only one.

Large corporations have *hijacked* copyright -- as I'm sure you'll get to, later in this video -- and The Law, which is *supposed to reflect what the citizenry thinks is the way things ought to be -- doesn't reflect what we want anymore. 

The test for Fair Use, in American copyright law, has 4 prongs, and you generally need to make a good showing in court on at least 2... and the one you've glossed over to this timestamp in the video is the one I think is at least as important as any other: Commercial Use. 90% or more of the things you've talked about are just people goofing around; not things they are doing specifically for commercial remuneration.

There are edge cases, of course, but...  well, let me take my break, and watch the other 22 minutes when I come back.",0,2020-03-23T21:28:19Z

For very story focused games, I can see videos on it depriving it of money, but there are also a *ton* of gameplay based games, and watching footage of something like that isn't a replacement for the game, it whets your appetite for it more than anything. If I'll take a very recent example, DOOM Eternal. While there is a story focus, and one that I'm personally enjoying, the thing that everyone is excited about is the gameplay. The people in charge of advertising actually sent YouTubers and streamers to play it and make videos on it because that's the stuff that gets a lot of people hyped for games, watching on YouTube. Heck, it worked for me, that's the only game I've ever purchased for a full $60. I think the reason a lot of companies allow game footage is that a lot of games actually benefit financially instead of suffer, and it paints a good picture on their part.

UgxtVZXEAMA3ssSPYoB4AaABAg,0.03,0.854,0.116,0.9855,"The funny thing is, if you read the US Constitution (from which the original copyright laws for the US came from), they make the same exact argument. They recognized that:


1. The public is much better off with art (general term abstracted from a specific form of media) available in the public space without a requirement to pay the original artist (again sans form of media) to create new works of art.
2. Art (sans form of media) won't get made if there isn't some way artists (sans form of media) can profit from it. 
3. There has to be some balance between the public's need for art and the improvements to society it can bring and the artist's need to be able to earn a living from it.


All of the stuff we're talking about, the length of time an artist can claim ownership of the intellectual property and the ability to sell or lease those rights before those works of art become the property of the public to share and use as the public sees fit, the ability to use a piece of art in some form that benefits society without having to get permission from the artist, and even how an artist can get recompensence should someone try to violate those rights of the artist or owner of the Intellectual Property were outlined in the US Constitution back in the 1780's. They deliberately left things fuzzy because they could not have even imagined a world where audio and visual information of the real world could be transfixed into a medium that allows for copying and distribution of those sounds and images. And they would have no clue that it would even be possible to share those works in a digital, almost instantly accessible network.
I believe that the original framework (or at least the version of it in the 1975 Copyright Act) is a perfectly good and serviceable framework. It allowed for the rights to be licenced for the time period Tom recomended, and included a rough guideline (section 107) for when the material could or could not be used without needing permission. Sure, it will need to be updated for the modern world, with modern definitions that reflect our technology and times. And the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was supposed to be that update...

However, I still think that we need to campaign for a major change in copyright legislation. My personal opinion is that copyright should expire when the creater (or in the case of a band, the last member of that band) has died. If that's 50 years, that's fine. If it's 20 years, that's fine, if it's 2 months, that's fine. But our current system of copyright does not inspire creativity, it stifles creativity. Besides, laws should always reflect the views of the majority of the population because that's what they are there for. Laws have always changed. Remember when it was fine to burn people at the stake? Not acceptable these days. I hope copyright law will go the same way.
Either way, a fantastic video that will probably make quite a few people change their minds when it comes to ContentID and will hopefully make people more aware of the real problems that copyright law has and has had for at least the last 30 years. It was made for a world without internet, a world of printed books and magazines. A world without Memes, without Giphy and without Youtube.

And what these streamers offer is ""a view of them playing the game"", which is quite different from the value proposition from the game developer which is ""the experience of you, the purchaser, actually making decisions/ reacting to game mechanics/  physically playing the game"". This is different from watching a movie where every viewer gets the same experience, wether they purchased it or not, gets more or less the same product. So imo I don't think that comparison is fair. The value propositions are too different, so much that they are essentially different products and consumers consume it differently. Like how iron ores and iron bars are different, no doubt when I donate/ ""purchase"" the viewing of a stream of my favourite personality playing a game and when I purchase the game itself, I am ""buying"" 2 completely different things.

On another note, to your point about copyright law treating the lay people doing things like uploading clips as a punchline to a joke similarly to corporations when they do it, I understand your point but no I also don't think this should be the case. Because the essence and intention of these actions are vastly different. To me, it is a logical fallacy to equate  this same action as having the same impact and ""thus require the law to deal with this act similarly"". In criminal law, we agree that there is a clear difference between manslaughter in an act of self-defence and pre-medicated murder with intent. The action is the same, but intention is completely different, why shouldn't this cornerstone philosophy in law apply to copyright law as well?

Imagine the era before the internet, you bought a movie on DVD and invited your friends over to your house to watch it together as long as they give you the money to pay for the pizza when it arrives at your door. You got a monetary gain. You showed that movie to a friend with no transformation or criticism and you did not pay any licencing rights to show this to anyone else. Would you be charged under copyright law? Because by your logic, you would have commited a crime. 

And I think sites like gify are merely  public places for people to meet and make friends. They are not media publishing sites. They are public forums. What individuals do there, like sharing clips they think is funny with their friends/new people they meet online, is in the same spirit as calling a friend or a friend of a friend over to watch a movie together. There is definitely a difference between these  individuals sharing something they enjoy in either a private or public forum, and a large media corporation using it as part of their published works without criticism or transformation or credits",0,2020-03-23T20:56:28Z

I mean in a world without cheap, effortless copying you wouldn't really need copyright. If I want a Tesla model S, even if some other company made something really similar it wouldn't be the same. Even if they got all the schematics it might not be up to the same quality standards as the one produced by the people who've been involved in every step of the design of the vehicle. 
But if I write a song my business model consists in using the power of the State to restrict the freedom of everyone else to use that numerical sequence(frequencies and time intervals) that I came up with. People are not taking anything away from me(I still have the song even if someone else plays it, unlike stealing a physical object), in fact it is I who, by the act of coming up with that sequence, has stolen the right of everyone else to use it so I can charge money to return that freedom, with the power of the State backing me. If I live for 60 years after that, then that's 60 years of that State-backed monopoly on the usage of that sequence, plus 70 years where my descendants, who had absolutely no involvement in the creation of the sequence and who might be as creative as a rock, will still get the right to demand money to have access to the sequence. 

In any case I would get it if copyright where 10, 20 years at the most. It's plenty of time to take advantage of your exclusive rights to get money back for your effort. Then I think it's time to come up with something new, and let society build up on your ideas. 

Also, art not only existed but thrived for thousands of years before copyright law. Being able to create something once and then charge for access to reproductions is a relatively recent development. And it's a relatively small minority of creatives that gets to create something once and live ever after from it while most are still paid by the hour, the copyright being owned by their employers, so it's not like it's been a revolution for artists.",0,2020-03-23T20:54:42Z

And before you say ""that couldn't possibly work"", consider that _every image on Wikipedia_ (except for the handful of Public Domain ones) is used under a copyleft licence.


Of course, that means that you in turn can't demand royalties from other people using _your_ remix, which might suck if you're too unimaginative to think of any better method than bit-rent for making an income from your work.


Incidentally, if copyright were eternal, as you discuss at 33:25, then there wouldn't _be_ any Shakespeare to collect licence fees on, because Raphael Holinshed would have served the Bard a cease-and-desist.  (However, Luigi da Porto wouldn't have sued over _Romeo and Juliet,_ because Ovid's heirs would have sued _him_ for _Giulietta e Romeo_ being a blatant rip-off of _Pyramus and Thisbe._  Though Shakespeare might have gotten away with his use of _Pyramus and Thisbe_ in _Midsummer Night's Dream;_ it's parodic and at _least_ as transformative as MST3k.)",0,2020-03-23T20:10:03Z

I mean at 95 years, its unlikely for someone who is alive when a work is produced will ever see that particular work move into the public domain, but at 50 years even if they'd see it they'll be in their 60s by the time stuff from their teens is released -- well beyond the average age of most Youtubers.  But that's maybe not the end of the world.  They can introduce their grandchildren to stuff from their youth and those grandchildren can make of it what they will.  Provides some level of generational transfer that 95 years may in some ways prohibit.

Life+75 for individuals is a bit nuts though.  Most artists peak between their mid-20s to mid-40s.  With an average age of ~80 years (rounded for ease,) that means 40-60 years of their life + 75 -- potentially 135 years of copyright.  And I'm not sure that its very legally clear what would happen if during year 134, the artist's great-great-great-great-grandchild sold the rights to a corporation.  Presumably since its defined as ""publication+95"" for corporations, it would automatically enter the public domain (being almost 40 years past that) but I imagine any such corporation would immediately claim that the original creation was not a ""publication"" (given that most individuals who retain their work for that long likely wouldn't have made it widely available to the public.)  So if they could successfully argue that (not that they're likely to need to -- very few works are even remembered never mind relevant 135 years later) then potentially the work could remain copyrighted for up to 229 years!  That's pushing 10 generations!

It was clearly a case of gross negligence in fact checking the claim. I wanted to fill a harassment complaint again the company to get their account closed. But YouTube refused to act. I could have sued in a local court (we have a law that nullifies the notion of choice of court). But it means wasting more time and money. In a proper system, the claim of harassment and false statement under oath should have placed the employee who filed the original claim under criminal charge and the company sued for liability. But to be realistic, there access to YouTube should have been terminated. I was not the only case with them. YouTube should add in their TOS a clause that a company filing a claim should pay 100$ each time where they get their money back only if the case is properly documented and proven.

If people move to such places in big numbers and it's set up to be completely anonymously then what would happen (money can still be made).
One important thing to note would be that it would not be in any country, is there truly an international law for this to begin with (since, Russia, China, North Korea, and many other countries might not adhere to your standard copyright law)?
Secondly how is anyone going to be brought to court if it's set up to be anonymous? (I think asking for anonymity is still reasonable and fair)

Basically, you'd retain the rights to the terms of your licensing for 5 years (when most of the money is made), but all creators would be allowed to use your work for a flat fee after that point. I'd rather it be something more like full-blown copyright for 2-5 years, followed by 15 years of CC-BY-NC-SA-ish licensing (plus compulsory licenses for commercial works), then 30 years with a CC-BY-NC-esque license and compulsory licensing for commercial works, followed by CC-BY for eternity. Attribution should be mandatory unless the creator explicitly waives their right to it or the author is unknown. I don't think Disney should still be making money from Pinocchio, but they do still deserve to be credited for it. But the Bible? We have no idea who actually deserves the credit, though I suppose the chapter and verse is good enough for attribution.

They aren't mad because they think that YouTube is doing anything illegal with their copyright system even if they say otherwise. What they are actually mad at is the morality. The morality of the brutal power disparity between individual content producers and large companies wielding the law against them which in this case is actually YouTube's fault. YouTube and other companies like ride share companies like the ride sharing apps Lyft and Uber make their money by ""employing"" millions of people (""independent contractors"") that produce their product (videos or transportation) without fair compensation.  I'm sure sometimes as a percentage of profit the pay is appropriate but that ignores the fact that by divorcing themselves of any sort of responsibility that traditional companies would have over their employees allows them to sell their products at a rate that would out-compete any competitor that tried to provide a similar service with even a modicum of employee support. The idea that YouTube is just an innocent bystander enforcing the law while benefiting immensely from the work of millions of people who they do not train or provide legal support for is wrong. YouTube's parent company Google (or I guess technically Alphabet) is one of the largest in the world and the only reason I can imagine that can't provide some level of support to the people that are it's bread winners is that it's fundamental structure is exploitative. So on the one hand they are at fault for not providing support if they can or on the other they cannot make money without exploiting people and should probably be closed down so another service that isn't fundamentally flawed can takes it's place.",0,2020-03-23T18:39:43Z

Mabye we want to move away from paying for art and towards paying people, that do art so they can make a living out of their craft without having to prevent others from remixing and redistributing their work. And there are solutions for that:
Open Lisences (more widely known as creative commons) and Plattforms like Patreon.


But those are basically just bodges as well trying to fix a broken system.

Open licences need to be more widely used and properly protected by law. Because you basically cannot put your work in the public domain even if you want to. You can say you've made it CC0, but when you actually read the fineprint on the creative commons page, you see ... CC0 is kind of in a legal grey area and it basically just works, because most have agreed to respect it.


We need to gain a better appreciation of this open art, we need to find better ways to support people, that want to do open art and we need to learn as a society: there are stories, that are incredibly important to tell ... but that simply won't get told because you wouldn't find a big enough audience to justify putting in the money to make those projects. But we still should find a way to make them happen and get the people paid, because of what that provides for our culture.",93,2020-03-23T18:37:35Z

Human Safari pressed charge and won very little money.

The only reason that one group is protected, they have the right to a career in taking pictures of stuff, where as another group of people don't have that right to a career. There is no law that says you have the right to make a living off any career you choose. If the why do photographers deserve a job? Of course this is a silly argument, everyone knows the arts are important. Why do youtubers have to play by a different set of rules? Because YouTube is a single company they rely on entirely?

I don't think you could do it based purely on how long the copyrighted content played for vs how long the video was _(not all part of the video are equally valuable),_ but in the case of a creator who accidentally use copyrighted material in music that only plays for a small portion of the video, even a 50/50 split is better than nothing.
(Edit)
I'm aware that there is a revenue split when there are multiple copyright claims on a single video; I'm talking about defaulting to letting the creator in on that split, except for in obvious(?) cases where they've just uploaded someone else's content.
i.e. In the case of a creator performing a cover, the creator might default to getting 50% of revenue for the performance, while the copyright holder gets the remainder for the composition copyright.

I'll break it down based on the 4 main tenants of Fair Use that are seen, in my view. Of course this is not legal advice, but have been arguments brought up by the likes of the late Totalbiscuit in the past when it comes to this topic

1. The Transformative factor: Tom here in the video implies that the playthrough of an interactive medium does not amount to enough transformation if you are playing through similar scenes every/most players. I disagree on this point. While criticism or satire is covered under special protection under the transformative factor under fair use, your work does not need to purely critique or be a form of satire but rather ""used to help create something new or merely copied verbatim into another work"" (Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors, Stanford University Libraries). Here, my argument is the additional element of entertainment provided by the creator through the medium of the video game in question. For example, I may not watch someone play through a horror video game for the video game itself, but rather the specific content creator in question being scared by situations in the video game. This additional layer of entertainment or enjoyment would be something I would never get through purely playing through the game alone, because there is likely no chance that my favourite content creator would be in front of me to scream from it. 


2. The Nature of the Copyrighted work: This is one factor that I'll admit I am not as familiar with this particular factor, it would be important to note that for most video games that require payment to access, one would usually not be able to attain access to the work unless payment is made, which is not necessarily through for the YouTube videos that come from it. I have not personally seen many cases flipped by this factor though

3. Amount and substantiality of the work used: This is the one factor that Ive seen more often than not weigh against streamers and/or lets play styled creators. Here it would be undeniable that a sizeable, sometimes all of the video game content would be used as a basis for content made by content creators, even if they cut out the cutscenes. The questionable part here would be whether the extent of content is necessary to create what is in my personal opinion, a transformative use of the game. Can a Let's Player realistically cut out major portions of gameplay that may or may not dictate idiosyncratic paths taken or subchoices made in how to approach a certain target or objective?

4. The Market Usurpation factor: This is where most of my concerns lie (along with the Transformative factor). Specifically, the notion of watching a content creator playthrough a video game amounts to a lost sale because of somehow drawing a parallel to have played the game yourself. For me, this would be a gross over-generalisation of what video games are, especially since the way you interact with a video/movie versus the way you interact through actually playing the game are markedly different factors. In most well-designed video games, you have the capacity to make different choices/approach missions in different manners with different setups, sometimes different from that taken by your favourite content creator. Personally, I would really budge against the notion of a limited interactivity media being a substitute for a full piece of differently interactive media. In my view, an argument can be made to separate and distinct the two markets, even if there may be people that are interested to be part of both markets: both for the video and for the video game.

Just my few cents, would be excited to see what others (or if Im lucky) Tom thinks xD",0,2020-03-23T17:54:28Z

If I take photos or paint paintings in a new exciting style, they can still influence other artist even if I own the copyright. However If I invent something new and exciting no one else can do it, this is why you can't prevent someone from licencing a standard which you have patented.

Do you know how many YouTubers I've heard of that had hundreds or thousands of their videos copyright struck by massive companies (weirdly enough, all included Warner Chapel) for music that the companies didn't own?? (Mumbo Jumbo, Matt Lowne, and Adam Neely just to name three.) All these people losing their income because a multi-million dollar company auto copyright strikes every video on their channels overnight, and YouTube does nothing. YouTube always sides with the companies. YouTubers have had thousands of videos taken down, but of course they can only appeal three before their channel is terminated. Three! Yet these companies suffer no consequences for wrongly striking YouTubers.

Haha, true. But isn't this a bit different? Copyright vs IP?

Also about Content ID: I agree that for the most part, it's about as good as it can be under the current laws, but when claiming ad revenue from other people's videos and filing DMCA claims, the big firms have too much power and there is very little the small youtuber can do about it. Even if you appeal, by the time the revenue goes back to you, a good portion of the money that video will ever make is already gone. If the appeal goes through, any money claimed by then should be refunded. Also sometimes Game Developers strictly allow youtubers and streamers to post and stream videos using their game, but when you do something they don't like, like criticise the content a bit more harshly than they're used to, then they change their mind and file a DMCA, even though with criticism it would even be considered fair use.",0,2020-03-23T17:23:30Z

I have no doubt that even with changes in copyright law it is highly unlikely that youtube and it's media partners will wish to get rid of a system that can bypass the requirement of transparency and accountability.

As a comparison, github the world's largest code hosting site has far superior, albeit not perfect system. I'm sure many would agree that thr idea that youtube's internal copyright system isn't broken as well as our current copyright law is ridiculous.",0,2020-03-23T17:07:03Z

I know of only one case so far, where this has been enfored - a channel which uploaded videos of exceptionally good or bad behaviour in traffic,
BUT the channel always had blurred the plates of drivers criticised.
Still they good sued for showing the plates of parked cars and other not directly involved cars.

Yet, here you are showing number plates in your video. The person I am talking about said that e.g. TV have special journalistic priviledges so they can show plates. Do you have such speecial priviledge, and who can consider themselves to have such priviledge and who can't? This is a weird double standard, yet there are many traffic reaction channels and car-vloggers, moto-vloggers who show number plates.
Are they all sueable?
Would really love you, or anybody, to clarify what's allowed and what isn't. I know I'm asking for a lot, but since you are showing with this video that you generally are willing to put in the work.

In the past I have used an original song in the background of a video, that song was published by the original author under a Creative Commons licence. Many years later the video got claimed by some record label. I can only assume the artist had signed a deal with them. I responded with a copy of the licence that I held, as well as a hyperlink to where that media was still being distributed by the artist under that Creative Commons licence. However, I got an automated response threatening legal action. 

As mentioned in this video, I had no recourse because they have lawyers and I don't. I had a valid licence, and was able to prove it. Yet there was nothing I could do about it due to what I will assume was a lack of competence at said label. I would guess that the labels threats of suing were probably empty, since their main business proposition to artists was YouTube takedowns. 

But, I can't expect YouTube to die by the sword in moderating this. Since that could cause them huge legal liabilities.",0,2020-03-23T16:56:47Z

We need a sensible way to encourage people creating information, and rewarding those creating the most liked and most important information, without making information property. That is what most people agree on: that artist should be rewarded, and that someone can't just claim their work as their own. Abstracting those aspects to intellectual property is just a fundamentally flawed way to solve the problem, yet it's required for capitalism to function.

Which means the question of copyrights isn't really a question about music, artist or corporations: it is a conflict between human nature and capitalism, and it showcases the difference between personal stuff you ""own"", and private property one owns.",0,2020-03-23T16:51:58Z

But equally hilarious, you can then sample the music or sound right before that, do the same at Distrokid, then claim my video as well. Then, if you're Time-Warner, you can bypass all of that and serve a DMCA from manual review with absolutely zero material from the complainant, re: Adam Neely's video claimed by Warner music for the section of the video playing JOYFUL NOISE not the section playing KATY PERRY even though Warner doesn't own Joyful Noise but YouTube just pushes the ""Accept"" button without bothering to investigate. 

The system doesn't use content id for most claims, it uses the honesty policy. They accept the claimants view without legal ramification even when the claimant admits at a later date that they claimed in bad faith, which IS illegal at least in the US. Filing in bad faith in the US courts has a precedent of going poorly for claimants. But not so when filling in the non-judicial YouTube court of corporate bureaucracy. 

Copyright law isn't the issue. Youtube didn't use copyright law. It uses ""who is the largest corporation making a claim"" law. Warner beats Distrokid beats you&me. No one beats Warner even when you win in court becayse you cost them 3 million while they false claimed 6 million in revenue. It's a net gain.

How to fix it, though? If Youtube wants to allow an algorithm to determine Fair Use or infringement, fine. But they accept the responsibility of adjudicating the appeals. That's the only change needed. Then suddenly they are liable for the bad faith claims. If they want to serve as an extra-judicial arbiter of revenue outside of the official courts, then it is only fair that they service all appeals.",0,2020-03-23T16:46:26Z

Sure, you want your original work to be protected and must be compensated if someone wants to use it to try and profit.
But, if you're suing individuals for obscene amounts of money who are using it for non-profit or for just some miniscule amount of it just because you can, there's something wrong about that.
It is said that Laws are the codification of common sense; and you cannot possibly code for every different situation that can arise. So, I hope the attitude changes from upholding the letter of the law to upholding the spirit of it !!",1,2020-03-23T16:36:20Z

This happens a lot more often than with covers of modern songs because a lot of classical pieces are written in a way that encourages fairly consistent performances, not putting your own spin on it the way cover artists like to - but each person's performance is still their own individual work, and YouTube's search-and-destroy bot is very bad at recognizing the little details that make them unique.",0,2020-03-23T16:25:17Z

I love your content Tom, but I don't know if its actually plausible to defend the stance that youtube's copyright system isn't broken.

Sure, the world's copyright system is flawed, but youtube actively allows deliberate copyright claim abuse because it is cheaper than defending its userbase.

Edit: 20 mins in, still think youtube's system is broken. Moreso, I feel like your argument about gaming videos being copyright infringement was interesting, but the delivery felt a bit aggressive. Yes of course according to the law it is copyrighted content, but it shouldnt be. You might not have bought those games you ""substituted"" by watching them on youtube, but it wasnt just you watching it. And be honest, you wouldnt have bought those games anyway. If you were planning to, you wouldnt have watched those videos. You probably wouldnt know of the games were they not to pop up for you in youtube. Untittled goose game wouldnt be nearly as popular as it is, and it wouldnt have sold nearly as much as it did, without content being created from the game.

So when the gaming community backlashes againts aggressive copyright claiming, wether it is lawful or not, it isnt because they are entittled and feel like they own the rights to the games, but because being able to stream and make videos of games is beneficial for literally everyone involved.

If you wanted to try a game before youtube, you would have to pirate it. Now you can just watch some gameplay a couple reviews and know wether you want to spend $60 on it. Now piracy is still very much a thing, but it mostly happens when piracy is a better service than the provider. So for example epic launcher exclusive games will be pirated because people want to avoid their launcher and boycott them, while the same people might have no issue shoving $60 into a game on steam. but lets not derail any longer.

The gaming community's major strenght is the community part. Gaming is the biggest entertaining industry and one of the reasons for this is the sharing of content. The experience of playing a game cant be simulated by watching a video of it. So for the most part gaming videos boost the sales of the games shown in a similar fashion to how piracy helps big studios through word of mouth. (Try not to pirate from small studios though, they dont benefit from it nearly as often as big ones do)

Do I think we should get rid of copyright laws? No. I can't imagine how tough it could be for an artist to not have some of these laws protecting their work. But we definitely need to define much more leeway into what is acceptable for a free to watch video or stream to show and profit from through ads, but not paywalls. (In this case it would make sense to define how many ads are acceptable for  a stream or video containing light use of copyrighted material, with considerations regarding what type of copyrighted content is being used.)

Reaction channels that just rip off other content and put a facecam on the side would still be infringing on copyright through this logic, but youtubers like you should be able to show an album cover without being affraid, amongst other things you weren't able to. Showing that album cover is not going to hurt its sales. if anything it might cause people to look the album up.

Few more minutes in, you actually give the argument to sustain the premise for your tittle. And it doesnt prove that youtube's content ID isn't broken. it just shows that it is arguably better than nothing.
Mind you Tom these are just my criticisms. Were I to attempt to praise all that I've liked about the video this comment would be 5 times longer, so please dont take this comment in a negative light. In the off chance that you read this I would love to hear some of your thoughts on what I have brought up. 

Thanks for the thoughtful, in depth videos you make.",0,2020-03-23T16:13:46Z
