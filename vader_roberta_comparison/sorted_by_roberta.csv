Just another reminder to everybody: fair use is meaningless to most people, as they often violate it themselves or are not capable of proving it in a court due to costs (which are high due to hours of work and the potential costs of defeat).

We can essentially just keep rolling the dice with Content ID and such, or be prepared to walk away from it all. Sucks, but until both copyright isn't as long term and fair use is a more accessible defense, the copyright owners hold all the cards and power.

Not that they shouldn't, but nobody should be shocked by this abusive behaviour, nor should anyone presume good intentions from a corporation in the business of copyright enforcement or acquisition. The whole ""plus author's lifespan"" bit should NEVER have been permitted. If we're serious about NOT inheriting wealth (we are, but even so), the descendants of a great author shouldn't be capable of living a life of luxury from their work. Stop the corporations from acquiring  copyrights they put NO EFFORT into creating, and then make money off of said copyrights' violations.

"The problem with things like ContentID is that it does not at all work in classical music. You can very often see an automatic claim for a recording because a different recording is in the database.
But even if it is someone uploading or using a recording it is absolutely infuriating, especially since YouTube does not offer an option to refute this claim (the only option is to say: All content is mine). If you are using some recording, you might well be okay with the label taking some revenue, but you surely are not wanting some completely unrelated label profiting from this, because they have a recording of the same piece in the CID database.
This get’s even worse when live broadcasts of concerts are put on YouTube by an Orchestra, an organizer or some radio channel, and you get a f***ing claim for using some recording.
And then there’s the thing with old recordings, that do not have property rights anymore. You basically can legally do anything with such recordings, as long as the compositions are in public domain. But then you get things like Naxos who transfer old recordings, and since those are then in the ContentID database, YouTube will assume that Naxos has the rights to this recording.
So basically ContentID should not be used for classical music. It just doesn’t work, and make YouTube take part in a hugh violation of copyright themselves, because they are making money (or helping others make money) for claiming the copyright for something that they do not have.",0.8109294,0.1691376,0.01993299,0.0,0.577,0.423,0.765

"this video only takes the stance of copyright being okay because its just the law.

It doesn't take the time to objectively discuss its morality and justification.

Just because its law isn't justification, a lot of dictatorships, monarchies, communist, and socialist countries have laws that are blatantly immoral.

As an example that would probably piss you off Tom Scott (The queen of England is essentially a tyrant who refuses to use her tyrant abilities) No society should have one person as the ultimate ruler (England is basically a socialist country which is just rolling the dice on each ruler for the eventual tyrant, its not a question on ""if"" a tyrant will rule England but ""when"". )  

As for America, any tyrant can be throw in jail and over thrown or simply not re elected next term.

So yea, you cant make a video explaining a bunch of different copyright laws and the shenanagins on how they work without objectively viewing them through a logical scope and a moral scope.

"This is where our governments and The Law completely fails us. When creating a law that is suppose to have final say over what is legal and what isnt, especially when it comes to something as simple as using a video or a piece of music, there should be NO grey area. It should be cut and dry simple. Having those grey areas is what allows big corporations to effectively screw over the little guy, even if they did NOTHING wrong all because they can't afford to pay the legal fees in order to defend themselves.  They have effectively locked people's ability to defend themselves behind a Pay wall. So it doesn't matter if your 100% in the right, did everything the correct way and the corporation that is sueing you is just being greedy bastards trying to literally STEAL your money.  If you can't afford to fight it in court, at best you just have to  remove the content you depend on for money and at worst you end up paying out a lot of money to a corporation that legally doesn't deserve it. The current copyright laws have made a modern day version of highway robbery a VERY easy thing to do and for large companies a lot of the times a VERY lucrative business practice that some businesses are completely centered around.

"Honestly, I don’t have any inherent problem with ContentID under current copyright laws. Yes, it makes a lot of mistakes, but that’s inevitable, really, especially at this scale.

There’s also the fact that, even if the claim gets overturned, any revenue during that period goes to the claimant (if they allowed ads but just wanted the revenue) and the YouTuber gets nothing for that time period. Similarly, I wouldn’t mind the copyright strikes system (since it’s mandated by the DMCA anyway) if there were consequences for making too many frivolous claims, but that’s a legal issue rather than a YouTube issue.

And that’s the key issue: ContendID isn’t the real problem; copyright law is.

"For classical music performances, Content ID is broken.

Being that a piano sonata from Beethoven, or a violin concerto by Tchaikovsky has been recorded thousands of times, it is inevitable that some seconds of your own performance have similarity to 1 or more recordings. Then, you automatically get a claim (or more) and some random Polish recording company get to place advertisements on your videos.

Once you cycle through your videos and find a claim,  you disputed and 1 month later it is removed but, by then, another of your performances has been claimed... It is stressing.

It is usual to find a video of an elder pianist sharing his performance of a classical piece, and see that it has been claimed multiple times. It gets ridiculous to the point that in the description of the video, shows the content to be from multiple pianists across different ages, nationalities and recording houses.

I think with orchestral music is worse. I suspect the Content ID system has big tolerances and is flawed when judging over complex sounds.",0.76703656,0.21042569,0.022537792,0.166,0.75,0.084,-0.7003

"The problem is that humans.have a natural urge to be selfishly greedy, which is why there exists ownership of resources—property. Given the existential risk involved in physically fighting each other to acquire ownership of a resource, we have come to impose upon ourselves the ""civil"" alternative we call ""trade"". This necessarily imposes upon ourselves some kind of set of governing rules, to wit, an economic system, which necessarily puts price stickers on everything. Since we each have only a finite amount of resources (such as money) with which to trade at any given time, an economic system is a rationing system, allocating resources according to some or other criterion. (Capitalism, for example, allocates resources fundamentally according to the individual's innate ability to acquire them, which is unfair given that innate ability is unchosen, unalterable and personally unique, resulting in inequality of personal outcomes. Capitalism is also inefficient; for example, rival pharmacological companies not sharing commercially sensitive research—hiding research-discovery pieces of the same treatment jigsaw from each other—resulting in unnecessary duplication of effort and precluding the efficiency which is the building upon each other's research and discoveries. ""USSR communist-type"" economies stifle endeavour as the people are allocated resources equally no matter what any individual's productive output. *All* economic systems are unfair and inefficient, stifling progress, by definition.)

What you do see ALOT, is companies using copyright as a shield to target only bad reviews or videos showing how much of a buggy disaster their game is.  
The backlash has nothing to do with the copyright, the backlash is because the gaming community knows why they are using the copyright and that they are using it specifically to hide how terrible their product is and they want us the consumers to buy their disaster of a product before we realize it's a broken mess and ask for a refund.   The gaming community has had to put up for years with games being in an unplayable downright fraudulent state, SIC cyberpunk 2077 or games that are ideologically tainted SIC The Last of Us pt 2.  For example The Last of Us Pt2 had very clear ideology in the story that they knew would alienate and infuriate fans of the series, they did their utter best to make sure the public did not know this until release date in the hopes that they could get us to buy something we did not want, in other industries selling someone a product that turns out to be significantly different than advertised would be called fraud, but for some reason games developers can get away with this kind of behavior and use copyright as a weapon to prevent people from discovering their fraud.

"Content ID as a starting point is not broken. The appeals system is 100% broken, because (as you pointed out), Youtube taking steps to fight abusive uses of it/force abusers of the system to issue actual DMCA notices might potentially open them up to lawsuits, and they don't care enough about content creators (the people who make them money) to do that.

Almost the entire video is just ""this thing you thought is legal, is not"". Which is great and all. But does not make youtube system not actually broken. Because for all that many many instances of copyright infringement are legitimate. There are also many many examples where the copyright strike is not legitimate.
This video would be more accurately called ""why many to most individual examples of youtube copyright system being broken is actually not youtube's fault but the law's fault"". or even a ""youtube's system is not broken in the way people think"". But many examples does not an always make, and even if it did, there are some broken parts of the system.

The youtube system does not actually allow you to say ""youtube, stop helping, I am taking them to court"". instead youtube takes over for the courts and just steals the creator's money to give to the copyright claimant, or just removes all the content with no recourse.
This is not something required by law but something youtube decided to do on their own. Youtube system can be helpful to ""a kid that accidentally infringed"". but is not helpful for people who did not and actually want to sue the false claimant

Plus youtube has some really stupid arbitrary restrictions. an aggressor can issue an infinite number of a strikes but a defender can only defend against 3 at once. Again not a legal requirement but something youtube is doing just to screw the small guy

German law for example does not know ""fair use"" or ""open domain"". Project Gutenberg is geoblocked there and so are most open library services.

On a different aspect is ""ownership"" of software. There's a myrrhiad of smaller libraries of Abandonware, all of them are ""illegal"" and have been subject to lawsuits for the past decade.

"Meaning copy right law would be ""fine"" if you could assure that both parties had fair ability to make their case. But when we have a system where only the rich win 99% of the time, regardless of legitimacy of the claim, then it doesn't matter.

I have seen MANY companies literally steal artwork, imagery and they will never get taken down, because they can pay for the cost whereas the person who would be making the claim can not.

Copy right itself is contentious to me to begin with. The idea of owning a concept or idea is really baffling and personally I think a lot of artistic work actually shouldn't be sold, but free if it's not commissioned but created through artistry to share with others.  But even if we're going to have a claim to none material things, then at least the fight between two parties should be won or lost not because of cost, but because the claim was or wasn't legally breaching.

"Public domain is another whole can of worms, in and of itself though isn't it?


Some creators and copyright holders (notably most of  those that talk about 'intellectual property' in a non-sarcastic manner) seem to want copyright to be indefinite (which... Would be very damaging)
But we're already at term lengths so long that it might as well be indefinite for all practical purposes.


Because of that, the very idea of 'public domain' has largely lost it's meaning in any realistic sense.
And copyright laws don't serve their original intended purpose when copyright lasts a VERY long time.


What little research there is on the subject of how long copyright protection should last given that original intent...
Well, it points to several issues;
- Firstly, within the margin of error for the research done, copyright terms should last no longer than 35 years, and may need to be as short as 7 years to have the original intended effect.
- Secondly, and more problematically, how long copyright protection lasts should be getting SHORTER over time, as more copyrighted works come into existence... (as, in a strict sense, the more works exist, the less value each has individually)


Trouble is, of course, that lobbying tends to have the opposite effect. Copyright terms keep being extended, and once they are a particular length, undoing it and going back to a shorter length appears nigh impossible.


A LOT of the most egregious problems we are currently facing would largely go away if copyright terms could go back to being maybe a decade or two, not measurable in more than a century...


But alas, the odds of that happening, given that the changes to the law over time have all seemingly gone in the opposite direction?
Well, that's just not very likely is it?

Youtube does have a copyright system, and although parts of it do work, other parts are definitely broken. That  three strikes policy is far more insidious than this video claims. If you use someone else's material when you shouldn't, your video should definitely be demonitised. If you believe you are in the right and dispute three of those claims, your entire channel is demonetised until the conflict is resolved. And getting your money back for that period? Good luck.

Same thing when you talk about little creators stealing work from big creators vs. vice versa. You state that the former is sometimes let go, yet the latter isn't. But I don't think that's a reasonable argument: huge companies *constantly* steal the work of smaller creators - just usually in a different way (though sometimes in the exact same way... look up the case of the guy who did the music for the ""you wouldn't download a car"" advert). 



I suppose this whole video just isn't really up my alley, since I believe copyright in and of itself is an unjust crime. Any extended argument about how copyright / trademarks work without asking if it's actually just seems like very technocratic ""tinkering around the edges"" to me.

Even fifty years is just ridiculous. Ridiculous. Pong, for fuck's sake, debuted less than 50 years ago. (Yes, I know Pong as such has essentially no copyrightable content in it. But that's kind of the point-- 50 years ago games were so primitive that they did not even have ideas in them, just incredibly-simple game mechanics.) Primitive text-adventure games like Zork aren't even halfway through their copyright terms. If that doesn't say all it needs to say about the insanity of copyright law, I don't know what can.

"I strongly disagree that copyright should only last for 50 years, dead stop. Tom also makes the claims that this would effect a tiny proportion of creators, and dismisses royalties as a bad retirement plan. This is all wrong. Authors often make serialised works that carry on original situations, characters, and world-building over many decades. Imagine the legal headache if the copyright ran out for the founding work of an ongoing series of science fiction novels or films while the original author was still active. Tom is also selectively forgetting that educational works, like texts and audiovisual series are added to and supplemented over many decades by single authors as a life's work (especially in the case of university texts).That is not a small category of authors by any means. Often such work is done with the expectation not just of retirement but also that their families who sacrificed many hours on behalf of the creative work will be looked after.

Content ID almost works. It would work with a very simple addition: If youtube would require a fee (similar to courts), if you loose a claim. That way companies would stop spamming claims (that are mostly against fair use) automatically, which is the real problem.
A company would not risk claiming 35 videos with 10 seconds of ""fair use"" regalated material in each (like a snippet of a song playing on a radio, when a person just wants to show that radio works), if  25 would dispute the claim. Even with just a fee of 10$, that would mean a loss of 250$ for the company.
And 250$ can not be that easily made back with the 10 remaining legit videos.
So those copyright claim companies would have to start using people who know what a legit claim is, instead of bots that should not exist. This is what breaks the system.

"Wow. Very sensible. I've always thought copyright should remain at 50 years (it still does for Crown copyright in the UK). As an author myself I'd love it if it was 20 years after date of death. Why should my distant descendants benefit from my hard work?  Orphaned works are the worst. I know of several cases where things that were published in *the 1890s* are still in copyright because the authors of those works lived very long lives and died in the 1950s - it shouldn't require researching the family history of someone to deduce who the rights holders are. What's even worse is that every step up in copyright length is made retroactive.

I think that the biggest problem, at least in the US, is not with copyright law itself but with how lawsuits are handled. The fact that a defendant (or plaintiff for that matter) in a lawsuit will have to pay their own legal fees regardless if they win or lose means that the mere threat of a lawsuit is enough to make people cave.

"I've got a couple opinions on this now, after watching the video. Feel free to criticise me, 'cause I'm just some 17 year old kid writing this on the toilet, so I'm obviously not the smartest guy around.

1. I feel like the UN should work together to form new copyright laws internationally. Considering small creators, large companies, and everything in-between. 
Obviously, this isn't very feasible, that would be MASSIVELY expensive, and there are other, more important things going on in the world than copyright. But in an ideal world, that is what I would like to see. A new, built from the ground-up UN enforced copyright system, for all countries in the UN.

2. Smaller businesses should be given some sort of compensation to go up against larger businesses. 
I don't know if this applies outside of Australia, or if I've been taught an over-simplified version of it, but in business class, we've been taught there are 5 kinds of businesses. Sole trader, Partnership, Private Limited Companies, Public Listed Companies, and social enterprises. If a Sole Trader or Partnership goes up against, say, Disney in court, that is extremely unfair. How can the correct outcome be met, and justice upheld, if Disney is gonna have WAY better lawyers? On top of that, I don't think it's particularly fair for social enterprises to be affected by copyright law, as they aren't even looking to make a profit (I don't know if there are already laws around this, I'm just splurging out my opinions into a youtube comment). 
Now, this still creates issues for youtube. Who is the business? Is it youtube themselves, or the actual content creators? Or is it some sort of a mixture of the two? But I think someone smarter than me could probably clear that up.

I probably just said a lot of really stupid stuff, so go ahead and lay into me. I'd rather get cleared up on how this actually works than remain ignorant.",0.67276126,0.2773119,0.04992688,0.069,0.749,0.183,0.4215

"""20 y will never go through modern politics"" well, that actually seems to me to be the more aggregious point. That and the lobyying thing. These assholes rule our lives - lawmakers - and it's a fantasy, it's unrealistic, to expect them to make things better. What's the point of government, and even civilisation as a whole, if it doesnt make life better? There's expressions saying things like ""the law's the law"" and in my country they say things like ""where's there s a law there's no negociatioin"" (could also translate as ""there's no arguing against the law""). So where there's unfairness were just supposed to suck it up? copyright is just one in a loooooong list of garbage we have to ingest daily from lawmakers and if one country is garbage many other will be if not all due to international treaties. What really is broken is politics and it needs to change. It takes an almost generational effort to force changes like shortening copyright. You shouldn't ever break the law, find ways around the law etc. but..... if law is unfairyou also can't change it? You need to campaign a lifetime for any small incremental improvement in law even when unfairness is OBVIOUS, aggregious and glairing? What needs to happen is rational people and people in good faith have to metaphorically stage a coup in every country in the world or at least in western countries. And also I may add those people should also love freedom and wherever there is doubt they should  err on the side of freedom.

Personally if we are talking about ideals with copywrite there should be an amendment that excludes certain forms of copywrite work from being claimed in non commercial personal or comedic work like memes or small creator teams that can be classified as less than commercial organization (whether it be through animal revenue or people under employment). Mostly because in cases like memes or YouTube creators it's practically impossible to enforce copywrite in the sort of scale that law calls for. As such we see inconsistent use of copywrite law and incorrect preceptions of how fair use works. To fit the sclae of the internet the law needs to account for the impossible nature of enforcing such types of laws in the scale that is grandscale shitposting. In a since a company can't copywrite graffiti that bares resemblance to a character or piece of art because of how small scale and how wide spread commonly used tags can spread.,0.6389667,0.3267919,0.03424139,0.0,0.469,0.531,0.6731

Also, yes, fair use should be *massively* expanded for non-commercial use, and any sort of compensation or penal action on the side of the defendant should be void. Cease-and-desist should be the maximum damage that can be incurred.

Non-commercial derivative works with substantial alterations should simply be fair use, and something like Youtube's content-ID system certifying the substantial alteration should be enough to close the case in favour of the defendant, or at least shift the burden of proof.

Changing copyright protections for works that already exist doesn't make any sense, because they were already created. Changing the incentives later isn't going to retroactively change art in the past. The Sonny Bono law extended copyright protections for existing works, and I think that was wrong or at least misguided.

There's two ways I can think of to fix this, and I think they should both be implemented.  One, reviewers who consistently win appeals should not be flagged automatically.  Two, upon a won appeal, YouTube should retroactively give the profits to the YouTuber.

The problem on YouTube is not Copyright but rather copyright abusers who abuse the system to claim things they DO NOT OWN. and bet on creators not noticing or not bothering to dispute and appeal.

I suggest solutions:
1. A claimer MUST provide active contact email for direct negotiations.
2. Keep a credibility record system for the percent of successful and failed claims of each claimer and increasing and reducing their power based on that. (Fair and solves the copyright abuse huge issue on YouTube).

But that's NOT WHAT YOUTUBE DOES.  Instead, they REVIEW your counter-claim and DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES whether THEY think you violated copyright or not.  There is no lawyer involved, certainly no judge, just a quick bureaucratic yes-or-no decision.  If some yahoo who got assigned to answer the counter-claims today thinks you violated copypright because his bowels are acting up, YouTube will REJECT YOUR COUNTER-CLAIM and keep your video disabled (and keep the copyright strike against you).",0.6153693,0.34827992,0.03635071,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"After watching the video, I agree with 90% of this, as creator I disagree with 10% of this, see the activity of a copyright should come into play and not plagiarize the original work either. Whatever enters PD should still respect the original work. Say your 50yr/20yr plan comes into play, and your copyright is a active intellectual property, such as is interacted with on a daily basis by a large audience or is used as a consistent means of income to a party, how are you specifically accommodating the creator/ self employment stability of that creator. I can understand static works that have no financial repercussions as in the author has no desire to profit from it. 

But put yourself in the eyes of craftsmen/ tradesmen/ artisans and artists, etc; that hone there skill religiously for years to have their vision completely ripped from them because the public is throwing a tantrum because you have been playing toooo long with a specific toy you made, it's comparable to having your house ripped from beneath your feet because you stayed there too long and it's someone else's turn, but you ""own"" it as in it is ""yours"". Copyright is there to protect the owner, so therefore that waver on a 20 year policy you proposed defeats the purpose of copyright itself. It should remain a lifetime affair, if it becomes a recognizable brand it should remain a copyright in next of kin or party of kin up until they decide it to be PD.

Or better yet place yourself in a position where your videos lose revenue because they have entered public domain..... but whine about the ""private media outlet"" despite it being a private institution that broadcasts media and profits, then pays employees who have livelihoods too and belong to the public, do you think you're suddenly not going to want your IP?

Over 10 years ago my amateur photo, published on my own website (we had those in past decade), was used to illustrate an article by one of the largest news portals in my country. They just cut the picture so my signature was removed. I politely wrote them. I didn't want money or takedown, I just wished to be mentioned as an author. The response wasn't even in legalese. It wasn't in PR jargon. It was just ""you can sue us, sincerely..."" - in those exact words. Since then I had dozens of pictures stolen in less impressive fashion. I had a web design stolen. With an exception of one identity theft for dating site, all those infringements were intentional and corporate. I know a few content creators, mainly photographers and graphic designers, all of them have such stories. And there is even less defense against that than it is against copyright strikes.

Copyright's best used is to protect the lil' guy from hungry corporations who look to steal good ideas and profit off them. Why should it work the other way around? Disney, Universal, Big music companies, etc will not go under because some people are using, obtaining, and redistributing their works for free; however the starving artist trying to make a buck to put food on the table will end up homeless if their works are stolen from.

Relating to stock images and footage, if you put your work on the internet and don't expect it to get stolen; that's like going to the marketplace in Madrid with a stuffed wallet in your back pocket and expecting to have that wallet by the end of the day. Don't be ignorant and protect your work like you'd protect your wallet. If they are really worried about losing their work than they shouldn't have online portfolios.

"Sure, copyright laws are not great but, that's not the issue here. People aren't mad over the law. They aren't mad because they think that YouTube is doing anything illegal with their copyright system even if they say otherwise. What they are actually mad at is the morality. The morality of the brutal power disparity between individual content producers and large companies wielding the law against them which in this case is actually YouTube's fault. YouTube and other companies like ride share companies like the ride sharing apps Lyft and Uber make their money by ""employing"" millions of people (""independent contractors"") that produce their product (videos or transportation) without fair compensation.  I'm sure sometimes as a percentage of profit the pay is appropriate but that ignores the fact that by divorcing themselves of any sort of responsibility that traditional companies would have over their employees allows them to sell their products at a rate that would out-compete any competitor that tried to provide a similar service with even a modicum of employee support. The idea that YouTube is just an innocent bystander enforcing the law while benefiting immensely from the work of millions of people who they do not train or provide legal support for is wrong. YouTube's parent company Google (or I guess technically Alphabet) is one of the largest in the world and the only reason I can imagine that can't provide some level of support to the people that are it's bread winners is that it's fundamental structure is exploitative.

"Well, you're not wrong. There is a fairly strong case to be made that all IP law is morally wrong, and frankly the historical precedents regarding IP law,especially copyright, are particularly horrible. In short, current IP law is a blunt instrument that was created to serve a very narrow range of interests (and historically speak, *not* that of the creators). The rise of a truly global community and economy through the widespread deployment of the internet has only exacerbated those problems. 

YT & FB are effectively the court system for this new constituency and they are essentially tyrannical and opaque. I agree with you that they are merely responding to regulatory pressures from the legal entities which have granted their articles of incorporation. That doesn't change the fact that they function as a legal system unto themselves. Given that law is a combination of explicitly codified and customary behavior (as should be obvious to anyone living under a common-law system), I do feel that there is a certain burden of reformation on the publishing platforms as well. And handling the moral ambiguities of copyright is actual an ideal place for common-law solutions. 

Sadly, it seems that the platform corporations have little desire to use their deep financial power to support the creators who contribute to their success. Because they certainly *do* have enough financial power to bring lawsuit against Disney, UMG, and others like them in order to encourage creativity and regulate the apportionment of revenue from different uses of pre-existing content. But the platforms have essentially aligned themselves with the publishers who created copyright to protect their investment in printing presses.

"Mostly good. And thanks for the regular reminder that you speak of what *is*, not what *should be* :).
.
I also agree on the main point of the ending. Copyright (and I'd add, patenting) is a mess. Even in and of itself it is questionable: a government-granted monopoly as a reward for innovation, is a monopoly nonetheless, and monopolies are easily misused. You make a very good point that it used to work (kinda) with big companies who can afford a legal team. And before that, it no doubt worked outright because the catalog was rather limited and lines were short.
.
But copyright doesn't work anymore. It stifles competition and innovation, and is just one of many avenues of eternal, ruinous lawsuits. When you need a lawyer to deal with it, as a regular person, the law is broken. And much of its application has nothing to do with its purpose.
.
From my understanding, in most media, the vast majority of sales are done in a matter of weeks. After that, anyone who wanted it, got it. Anyone who didn't yet get it, isn't willing or able to pay for it, so you won't miss any sales from them. Preventing them from copying your work (privately) does not benefit the copyright holder, and merely makes sure to deprive the poor from access to culture, prevents further innovation based on your idea,  and prevents your art from reaching a much larger audience. I see no benefit to this.
.
I dare say, the onus is on the copyright holders to explain why we should violate our core principles of freedom by granting them exclusivity, at all. There are cases where it's valuable. By all means, I don't want people profiting off ripping off someone else's work. Those who made it, deserve the paycheck. Perhaps use in formal publications should require permission, and commercial use should always be credited. But as a rule, it seems to me, you miss no sales, and society as a whole benefits, from most forms of copying. 
(and if someone gets DMCA''ed to shut up their criticism.. in my personal opinion, clear abuse of law to do harm upon others, is a crime against justice itself, and a hanging is in order ^_^)

"The sad truth is that ENTIRE COPYRIGHT SYSTEM IS BASED ON A LIE AND IS NOW CRACKED AT ITS VERY CORE.

We are being told that if we come up with the idea then we own the idea just like one owns a car or a bike. THAT IS A LIE. An idea is no property. Because what if two people came up with the same idea at the same time? Legal system only allows one of them to own said idea - then the other is basically robbed of his property. That situation is impossible in case of owning a physical object because by default two people simply cannot buy one and the same car without knowing about it.

Hence why the very concept of ""owning"" an idea is fundamentally unjust. 

Also the reason why copyright law was introduced is because it was widely believed that if people cannot forever benefit from what they came up with then they would lose interest in innovation. But this mindset was proven wrong on many occasions. Biggest inventors were typically robbed of their inventions by clever bastards who knew their way around the law. Look no further than Nikola Tesla vs Thomas Edison. Actually copyright law doesn't encourage progress but hinders it. Progress is mostly ensured by freedom of taking other people's work and improve it, making it even better. But entire copyright and patent system makes it very, very difficult.

You claim that if small youtuber uses copyrighted content than ppl tend to just smile but if an international corporation used content from small youtuber than it would be a big deal. What absurd thing to claim! Small artists were robbed time and time again by the big players. There were many cases when big artists landed international hit songs and later it was revealed that big parts of said songs were copies of unknown artists' work. Nothing ever came out of it because a small artist is powerless against famous pop and rock stars protected by large international music studios.

Current copyright and patent law only protects large players leaving them completely in control as small artists simply can't afford the lawyers. The world however becomes more and more decentralized. Programmers no longer need international corporations to make server OS like GNU Linux or office software like LibreOffice. Many fan productions rival million dollar films in terms of quality.

Another one (Street French) got their video demonetised because they mentioned COVID-19, and in YouTube's opinion, earning ad revenue from a video COVID-19 is somehow akin to profiting off people's deaths? (That seems absurd to me; the YouTubers are just sharing the reality of life that they're living, which is exactly what YouTube is supposed to be about.) I suppose that isn't a copyright claim, though.

So yes, Tom, while I agree that a lot of people on YouTube use ignorance as an excuse to violate the law, the problem isn't so much what happens to people who are actually breaking copyright.

In the US you have to apply for US copyright protection on any piece of work you do, whether it's a song, a video for youtube or a picture you drew, and it costs money, tons of money. You don't get copyright protections just because you claim its copyrighted when it's really not and you have not went through the proper channels through the government to apply for copyright protection.  Youtube gave everyone a false sense of security for some reason, on how they handle copyright claims. If you don't have a real copyright and the paperwork to back that claim up, then the only protection you have is Youtube honoring in good faith your false claim that you have a copyright on something.  Once you put something up on the internet, no matter which site you put it up on, it's in the public domain. You are giving your work to the world to use as they want if you have not protected your work with a real copyright through the US government. Youtube only takes down material when someone claims a copyright because it doesn't have time to check every claim, and that's where the abuse comes from. You make a video and upload it to your Youtube channel, and you don't get an actual copyright protection for it, anyone can now use that video or take that video and get a copyright for it, and once that happens they can legally profit off of it without worry of you, the original creator, of suing them because they now hold the copyright to something that you gave away to the public domain and there is nothing you can do about it.",0.563612,0.3890102,0.04737786,0.0,0.839,0.161,0.3612

"I am legit that person who is watching a Let's Play of a game like Pokemon or Animal Crossing while currently playing Pokemon or Animal Crossing, while sitting on the alternate version of Pokemon I haven't played yet because I will start a Nuzlocke on that game. While some people will watch Let's Plays and not play the game because of it, others who cannot afford the game at the time may fall in love with it and get it later, or one of the ""sequels"". There are also people that will buy games because they think they can play it better than the Youtuber or Streamer they were watching. 
I would love to see some raw data analysis. When you look at the pure numbers for units sold of Pokemon care series games, as an example, Diamond/Pearl sold 17.67 million copies in/around 2006, before people were widely uploading Pokemon content and Let's Plays. Pokemon Sun/Moon sold 16.18 million copies, and that game also tried an entirely new set up. Following that, Ultra Sun/Moon which had very, very little in the way of difference, sold another 8.77 million copies. And Pokemon Sword/Shield sold 17.37 million copies. Consider the wide range of video games available to people today, I do not think it is streamers and youtubers that are to blame for revenue loss. It's too much saturation of the same things, and _critic_ of poor games being incredibly immediate, visual, and passionate. A video review of a top hyped game that just destroys it is going to do so much more damage than someone doing a let's play and enjoying it. Hell, it's not like Pokemon cares. They know they hooked enough of us at 12 that they are going to have us buying both versions of every core series game they put out until we die. 
It's when Mass Effect Andromedas and Anthems come out as rushed, garbage and get ripped to shreds and the companies can't trick people into buying their buggy ass, unfinished game for more than a week that loses them buyers, and future customers. But of course the idiots in the industry would rather blame people for playing their games online than making polished, finished games, and releasing them when they are actually finished, and not jumping on fads that will be over before the morons are even half way through their slapped together clone.

How would it be if copyright was a gradual system? For example from the date of publishing to 5 years from it, you HAVE TO license it and pay whatever price the copyright OWNER asks for. From 5 to 10 years from date of publishing, the price for licensing reduces enormously and is not controlled by the owner anymore, rather another copyright institution, which somehow categorizes the work and licenses it for a flat fixed charge irrespective of what media company owned that work. After 10-20 years it should be CC license and after 50 years like you say, it should be public domain. Something along these lines is a win win situation for everyone involved except for the sucker cases who just want money irrespective of the cause or claim.

"So in essence,  YouTube's copyright system isn't perfect, but although it may do wrong for some, it'll do right for others.  I mostly agree with this sentiment because a lot of people fail to look at things objectively, and that's a major issue in society as a whole in today's world. There are way too many people who will do a number of things, either they'll fail to admit they're wrong (so few do) because who wants to say that they were in the wrong? Or they'll fail to research, taking the word of someone else from YouTube saying the same thing which could be misinformation, or them receiving it all wrong.  Or they'll blindly follow what others say, which is just a combination of both things said previously, but this can be with viewers on YouTubers they support. 


What we should make sure to do in everything relating to legality when posting (or watching) videos look at it objectively. Look it as though you don't have any affiliations with that video, that channel, only caring to see if this video is breaking copyright laws. You can then use that argument when facing a challenge against a copyright strike, but even throughout such, you have to be willing to accept that you may be wrong. The system is in place to protect people against actual people stealing content from hardworking people that may have had months, maybe years, as well as possibly lots of money put into that content. 


The area I slightly disagree with is saying that YouTube's Copyright system isn't broken, because it slightly is. If something is broken, that implies that it is not working in its peak whole form and with a case like yours, as well as other YouTubers who've put absolutely no copyrighted content (like TheFatRat with him putting all of HIS own music in it). I suppose to say something is broken is more subjective then it is by the fact such. A cup that has been chipped may not be broken to you, but it could be considered broken by someone else. A car with major dents may be broken to you, but to someone else, they may think otherwise.

In the past I have used an original song in the background of a video, that song was published by the original author under a Creative Commons licence.

I responded with a copy of the licence that I held, as well as a hyperlink to where that media was still being distributed by the artist under that Creative Commons licence. However, I got an automated response threatening legal action. 

As mentioned in this video, I had no recourse because they have lawyers and I don't. I had a valid licence, and was able to prove it.

Imagine if goverments had a way to surveil you and fine every single infraction of the law. Do we want to live by the letter or the spirit of the law. What we need is common sense of grace.

As someone who has inherited copyright works of a writer and performer, I disagree that the length of copyright should be decreased.

"Honestly I think copyright shouldn't apply to anyone with a small enough amount of exposure. It should only apply to people who have like 100k views or above. Otherwise it should be the wild west. Copyright shouldn't prevent creativity, and the internet should be a place of creativity above all else. Large media companies who want another couple million from the creative work they bought on bargain from a struggling artist can go screw themselves. The key here should be less legislation and restriction, reduce time before works move to public domain, and those with small audiences like community theaters and small youtube creators should be able to use what they want in the name of creativity. If they start making serious money on something, then that is a different discussion. Individuals who own copyright on their own creative works should get all their copyright revenue, but huge mega corps with CEOs earning 8 and 9 figure salaries who own an astronomical amount of copyrights they had no creative hand in actually making, and have draconian exploitative contracts with the actual creators of the content should have their cut heavily taxed, with the revenue from that tax going to national and local art and creative initiatives. Individuals should get paid for their work, huge companies whose entire purpose is to make money from someone else's work (and are the real copyright 'infringers' for that reason) should not. And that is what is truly infuriating about this whole situation. It isn't a problem that people want to make money from their work, it is that the only people who are actually benefiting from the current system are huge companies with tons of money and lots of lawyers, and not the people who actually contribute to the furthering of art, culture, and creative endeavors.",0.53492343,0.39677188,0.06830467,0.129,0.746,0.124,-0.0258

"There's an alternative solution: Creative Commons (and copyleft more generally).  Instead of remixing the latest saccharine crap from Disney or shouty noise from [whichever rapster the kids are listening to this week], you can just use works licensed under terms that say ""derivative works are allowed, but may only be distributed under this same licence"".  And before you say ""that couldn't possibly work"", consider that _every image on Wikipedia_ (except for the handful of Public Domain ones) is used under a copyleft licence.


Of course, that means that you in turn can't demand royalties from other people using _your_ remix, which might suck if you're too unimaginative to think of any better method than bit-rent for making an income from your work.

Those, within the EU at least and under certain conditions, are things that do not always require a license. 



I just wanted to clear that up.


But everything you say is also true: the copyright law itself isn't on track with public opinion. That doesn't mean that public opinion is always right, but that doesn't mean that the law is right either. On top of that though, something even more important to take into consideration is the fact that the catholic restrictions and exceptions we have for copyright do not work anymore in the form that they are. The world keeps on going forward, with more forms of entertainment being born every few years and with laws taking a long time to be modified for those things specifically. This is why we, for better or worse, we have many grey areas for many things, one of them being the emulation of video games, their preservation online and its connection and affiliation with piracy. 



In the world where the internet is truly powerful and where everyone has access to everything, the copyright law has restrictions which often do not take place and are dismissed completely. There's no proper security measures for copyright holders and it's confusing whether or not something is right or not.

"I never understood how it was either legal or ethical for copyright extensions to steal from the public (domain) for the benefit of, mostly, corporations far removed from the actual creative work. Each and every one of us is the victim of theft; we are being deprived  of the value we would have derived from that material being free to use, and each day there are new offenses as works that otherwise would have entered the public domain are diverted, the ill-gotten gains of political lobbyists.

It seems to me that any past sale of copyright can now be revisited if the term of rights was stated (or even implied) to be the default term in force at the time. I think it plausible that a creator (especially one motivated less by profit and more by seeking the widest reach) would only accept the restrictions on duplication sold to a publisher as a *temporary, defined* means to that end. For the present rights holder to assert that copyright extension applies alters the thing sold (the rights) beyond recognition and to me that would void the entire contract. I'm speaking of an ideal world, not the illegitimate mess of legislation we are presently burdened with. I'm obviously not a lawyer as I possess common sense and don't want the mess to continue to the benefit of the legal profession (which is simultaneously the oldest profession, the two being essentially the same).

"About what we should do to fix it. I agree that the length of copyright is a serious problem. But why should the age of the work be the determining factor? This entire discussion is, at its core, a question of how much profit is too much. Why not make copyright apply for as long as a work has generated less than ten thousand dollars (or an equivalent amount taking into account inflation, and obviously differing but similarly-culturally-significant amounts in other currencies) in profit for any persons or organizations who have held the rights to the work? In order to prove infringement, a claimant would need to prove that the total profit from the work is under the threshold. Yes, that would require effort, presumably mostly in recordkeeping. But I'm not sure it's any more effort than is required to prove infringement now. I'm also not sure if it's any less or the same, someone would probably need to do a feasibility study.

I'm of the opinion that profit is a harmful concept, and thus copyright is a harmful concept, and thus neither should exist, and from each according to their ability to each according to their needs, yadda yadda yadda.

I think, the way it is used ""pop culture"" wise, isn't too bad tho. 
If you do not just put up the entire work or barley edited (just for the sake of having something edited) original in and also credit the artist everywhere you can  
- like in the video/post, in the description, and also how and where to support them, I think it should be fine.

"Some of these ""criticism and review"" segments with the boilerplates still feel like a gray area, or at least in a sense misleading to the audience. For instance, the reason you were able to confidently use the Baby Yoda gif was because it had already become clear that Disney was not going to litigate it, not because you gave a 3 second critique of it whose substance was unrelated to the rest of the video (only the fact of its delivery). And the reason you were able to confidently use the clip of Untitled Goose Game is because showing a clip of a few seconds of a video game is not substantial, and the copyright owner has always allowed far more substantial gameplay footage in the past (including thousands of full playthroughs). But if you actually did make a video that was just about showing off copyrighted works and interspersing hurried two-sentence critiques, that probably would not be fair use.",0.50645477,0.4280043,0.06554096,0.044,0.887,0.069,0.0763
My ex girlfriend works for a small business that sells toys via amazon product they had for sale was ludo. the description of the game got picked up by a German company who threatened legal action over some copyright claim. her boss has to declare bankruptcy and relaunch his business to avoid court. so one business lawyer forced a business of 3 people to shut down over the description of a board game. I understand copyright if someone is making a profit and as a writer would peruse legal action if something i wrote was in a movie. copyright is a horrid grey area which should be judged on a value of positive gain . sorry for the ramble but its there i appreciate your videos and have introduced them to a work friend who has watched a few,0.5059923,0.39584255,0.09816514,0.0,0.732,0.268,0.6588
"This is a well made video. Very informative and gives insight to the copyright systems mentioned. I don't think it is a problem with the dmca system that people should complain about, but rather the people that abuse it. There are numerous companies and individuals that use it to either silence, troll, or even scam content creators. There are channels I have watched that are constantly fighting strikes and copyright claims on videos that involve police officers and their vest or dash cams because either the system YouTube uses to detect them thinks it's an episode of Cops or because some lawyer that's all the video thinks it's an episode. I have also seen instances where mysterious companies would pop up and claim a bunch of random videos and start collecting ad revenue from them. But as soon as somebody starts investigating to figure out who they are, they just disappear. You are right, this is not a problem with YouTube's copyright system. It's running as good as it can as it is. The problem is people. With any luck, the laws and systems in place now will be improved soon. But even if they end up becoming absolutely perfect, there will still be complaints. The thing about people is even when compromising, neither party really agrees with the arrangement. One wants more than the other in most cases. And there will always be those that try to exploit any system to get what they want at any cost",0.5058841,0.41359022,0.0805256,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Great video!  A couple of comments:
1) The orphaned works problem is a real pity, _no_ _one_ benefits from that situation.  One
      class of proposed solutions that I like is to require copyright owners to pay a nominal
      fee or file a form perhaps every few years to keep a copyright in force.  If a work is in
      in active use, the copyright will be maintained.  If it is truly abandoned it will become public
2) Content ID is interesting.  This reminds me of patent pools, though not quite the same.
3) I agree that having a huge disconnect between the law and actual practise is an
    immense problem.  In effect, it gives enormous discretionary power to whoever has
    enough cash to hire tons of lawyers.  Not a good situation.  Regrettably, I doubt that this
    is going to get better during my lifetime.  The trend, in criminal law as well as IP law, has
    been in the opposite direction.",0.50290537,0.3754681,0.1216265,0.166,0.664,0.17,-0.1962
"You were making a good argument until the end when you said that shortening the copyright term would only affect a few hundred people who were relying on their one hit for retirement. It takes a lifetime of training and dedication to became a songwriter or musician. One-hit wonders don't happen by accident usually. They happen because one person spent his life writing song after song after song and just by chance one of them got recorded and made a hit. That's not just a few hundred people. That's the vast majority of the music business. It takes thousands of people churning away making failed songs for society as a whole to benefit from the froth that all that churning creates for the really good stuff to be made. If you don't let one hit wonders and failed songwriters have a chance at making a decent living on what they spend their lives doing, then they won't engage in all that churn, and the level of froth will drop. Quality will drop, variety will drop, innovation will come slower. When creativity becomes something only hobbyists with another source of income can do, rather than a possible profession, then we will all suffer as a society. I say, yes, shorten the copyright term, but no shorter than the lifetime of the original creator.",0.5025882,0.3987104,0.09870145,0.039,0.775,0.186,0.6771
