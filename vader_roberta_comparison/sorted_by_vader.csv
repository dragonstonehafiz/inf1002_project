"I can register my outro music at Distrokid, then claim my own video via their DMCA service. But equally hilarious, you can then sample the music or sound right before that, do the same at Distrokid, then claim my video as well. Then, if you're Time-Warner, you can bypass all of that and serve a DMCA from manual review with absolutely zero material from the complainant, re: Adam Neely's video claimed by Warner music for the section of the video playing JOYFUL NOISE not the section playing KATY PERRY even though Warner doesn't own Joyful Noise but YouTube just pushes the ""Accept"" button without bothering to investigate. 

The system doesn't use content id for most claims, it uses the honesty policy. They accept the claimants view without legal ramification even when the claimant admits at a later date that they claimed in bad faith, which IS illegal at least in the US. Filing in bad faith in the US courts has a precedent of going poorly for claimants. But not so when filling in the non-judicial YouTube court of corporate bureaucracy. 

Copyright law isn't the issue. Youtube didn't use copyright law. It uses ""who is the largest corporation making a claim"" law. Warner beats Distrokid beats you&me. No one beats Warner even when you win in court becayse you cost them 3 million while they false claimed 6 million in revenue. It's a net gain.

How to fix it, though? If Youtube wants to allow an algorithm to determine Fair Use or infringement, fine. But they accept the responsibility of adjudicating the appeals. That's the only change needed. Then suddenly they are liable for the bad faith claims. If they want to serve as an extra-judicial arbiter of revenue outside of the official courts, then it is only fair that they service all appeals.",0.41476223,0.5022888,0.08294894,0.429,0.523,0.047,-0.9598

That said, I consider the abiilty for future creators to use stuff I make to be absoutely critical, because it's better to be deprived potential profit than to have these labors forgotten.  Of course, I'm only saying this because these creative outlets aren't how I actually make money to eat on a daily basis; while I'd like to think I'd have the same opinion if I managed to make a living out of it, there's no way in hell I could guarantee it if I was on the side of the equation that got screwed.

Basically, what I'm saying is that copyright is long overdue for fundamental reform and we need to ensure that artists are able to eat regardless of whether someone uses their work in something else, but the same wealthy elites backing neoliberal capitalism are the people who keep extending copyright and actively shutting down any attempts at changing it, so we're probably never getting out of this without a fundamental shift in our economic order.",0.3747935,0.4983959,0.12681061,0.331,0.669,0.0,-0.886

"In regards to video game publishers/developers , I'm happy that it's this way currently because it enables creators to expose the game and its potential flaws, only creating a betterment of the game itself, and popularizing it. In a sense, it's free advertising for the game publisher and creators, at the same time, sure you can criticize and even falsely accuse the game of something it doesn't have, and in that case you-tube could step in and highlight a critic of that said person by either the publisher or the developer, similar to how there's banners for fact checking on certain videos like those containing COV19, the earth being a certain shape etc. I'd much rather a system like that rather than a full on legal action pursuit against creators who simply take footage of a game, even if it doesn't seem transformative, because people want to see the game. They want to know what it is, how it plays and if it's any good. The same thing ""could"" be applied to anything of course, and game developers and publishers do have their own rights, but it's not a question of when they do, but should they do it at all?

Your right, so many people just put a line crediting photographer or original creator and think that makes it OK.  And you're right, if you are the original creator, it's frustrating as heck to have your work used without permission or compensation (stolen).  As a former photographer, I'm on the side of the artists.  If we wanted our work to be open for all to use we would sell to stock companies.  There are plenty of royalty free music and stock footage sites also.  Yes you have to pay a monthly fee, or buy credits.  That's how the artist get paid.

"If there's so many possibilities for a mafia/1984/existential Abandoned By Disney horror movie just based on the concept of copyright, that means only one thing. Scrub out all of the complicated stuff and start from the basics, and then calculate every reality possible to make sure that you can build the best framework for a copyright system, then actually get a group of people to test on their copyright systems or interview existing companies that abuse the current system and challenge them to abuse the new system before tweaking it as you go.
So, it's a guilty until proven innocent sort of deal, huh? That's frightening.
Actually, why not pay to create a huge group of people to help upload a whole bunch of copyrighted works that are created by original creators across the internet and just wait for them to get copyright struck, and then watch as the money built up from the years of the business growing have piled up and are now being spent to take everything to court to legally define everything.",0.5094126,0.428006,0.06258142,0.126,0.755,0.119,-0.7428

"I think copyright should kind of be based on how much you're making out of that content, if you're a big company like Disney, putting content in a film that will earn millions, then in that case the laws should be strict. If you're just a kid, or individual who doesn't make any or little money of their videos then copyright laws should be just a bit more forgivable.  And of course the laws should be varying for the varying amount of money that you're making. So if you earn a bit of money, you don't get let off as easily as someone who doesn't earn anything, but also aren't treated as a multi million dollar corporate entity. Of course these boundaries (a lot, a little, a bit) would be defined by law.

"For classical music performances, Content ID is broken.

Being that a piano sonata from Beethoven, or a violin concerto by Tchaikovsky has been recorded thousands of times, it is inevitable that some seconds of your own performance have similarity to 1 or more recordings. Then, you automatically get a claim (or more) and some random Polish recording company get to place advertisements on your videos.

Once you cycle through your videos and find a claim,  you disputed and 1 month later it is removed but, by then, another of your performances has been claimed... It is stressing.

It is usual to find a video of an elder pianist sharing his performance of a classical piece, and see that it has been claimed multiple times. It gets ridiculous to the point that in the description of the video, shows the content to be from multiple pianists across different ages, nationalities and recording houses.

I think with orchestral music is worse. I suspect the Content ID system has big tolerances and is flawed when judging over complex sounds.",0.76703656,0.21042569,0.022537792,0.166,0.75,0.084,-0.7003
"I watch a lot of gaming videos, I do tend to purchase the games I really enjoyed watching. I think getting rid of the Twitch/YouTube streamer's ability to use gameplay footage would have a negative effect on game sales. Remember Funcoland? they used to allow you to try out games for free before you purchased them, to help make sure you were actually buying a game that fits your tastes, It's kinda like that. Not every game has free demos out there for you to try before you buy, and with games/consoles slowly getting more and more expensive I would probably stop buying new games if I didn't have somewhere to watch an example of gameplay.

Watching a movie via stream is much different than watching a game via stream. Watching a movie via stream gives me the feeling of ""already seen it, probably don't have to buy or rent that now"". That is a loss for the movie industry. With a Video game playthrough, every experience is just different enough to keep me intrigued, and make me want to try playing it myself. (Avengers movies will always be great, but no matter how many times you watch them, they are the same movie. Every time you watch or play minecraft it's a completely new/different world/experience to watch/playthrough).

So obviously Marvel (and other movie studios) should watch their product closely to make sure no one is broadcasting it for free without their permission, and Mojang/Microsoft should continue working with the MC community (because it's free advertising, and keeps their game soaring in popularity). I wish Nintendo would learn from Mojang/Microsoft (Nintendo has been known to harass creators from time to time, and has actually sued on multiple occasions, when instead they should capitalize on the popularity of their games, especially some of their old IP's which cost almost nothing to reproduce and sell digitally).",0.21704663,0.4755847,0.3073688,0.162,0.838,0.0,-0.7003

"Copyright should be five years with an EXPENSIVE (like, tens of thousands of dollars) extension available for another five years. The overwhelmingly vast majority of works make all of their money within that time frame. The handful of super-successful works that do not, will already have made huge amounts of money by the time the exclusivity period is over. Maybe you can make an exception for something like stock photography, but it's not clear to me that stock photography is actually a business model that needs to exist at all.


Even fifty years is just ridiculous. Ridiculous. Pong, for fuck's sake, debuted less than 50 years ago. (Yes, I know Pong as such has essentially no copyrightable content in it. But that's kind of the point-- 50 years ago games were so primitive that they did not even have ideas in them, just incredibly-simple game mechanics.) Primitive text-adventure games like Zork aren't even halfway through their copyright terms. If that doesn't say all it needs to say about the insanity of copyright law, I don't know what can.


If big media companies want to complain about it, let them.

"So in essence,  YouTube's copyright system isn't perfect, but although it may do wrong for some, it'll do right for others.  I mostly agree with this sentiment because a lot of people fail to look at things objectively, and that's a major issue in society as a whole in today's world. There are way too many people who will do a number of things, either they'll fail to admit they're wrong (so few do) because who wants to say that they were in the wrong? Or they'll fail to research, taking the word of someone else from YouTube saying the same thing which could be misinformation, or them receiving it all wrong.  Or they'll blindly follow what others say, which is just a combination of both things said previously, but this can be with viewers on YouTubers they support. 


What we should make sure to do in everything relating to legality when posting (or watching) videos look at it objectively. Look it as though you don't have any affiliations with that video, that channel, only caring to see if this video is breaking copyright laws. You can then use that argument when facing a challenge against a copyright strike, but even throughout such, you have to be willing to accept that you may be wrong. The system is in place to protect people against actual people stealing content from hardworking people that may have had months, maybe years, as well as possibly lots of money put into that content. 


The area I slightly disagree with is saying that YouTube's Copyright system isn't broken, because it slightly is. If something is broken, that implies that it is not working in its peak whole form and with a case like yours, as well as other YouTubers who've put absolutely no copyrighted content (like TheFatRat with him putting all of HIS own music in it). I suppose to say something is broken is more subjective then it is by the fact such. A cup that has been chipped may not be broken to you, but it could be considered broken by someone else. A car with major dents may be broken to you, but to someone else, they may think otherwise. But due to the cases that both you and I have explained, I still believe that it is broken.",0.5496364,0.40315917,0.04720437,0.108,0.789,0.103,-0.6126

Youtube provides absolutely no mediation and won't even help connect the two parties so they could settle.

"If I may request your services: under GDPR (of course soon no longer relevant in the UK) it is illegal to upload information related to a person without their permission - I am thinking of number plates.

BUT the channel always had blurred the plates of drivers criticised.
Still they good sued for showing the plates of parked cars and other not directly involved cars.

Yet, here you are showing number plates in your video. The person I am talking about said that e.g. TV have special journalistic priviledges so they can show plates. Do you have such speecial priviledge, and who can consider themselves to have such priviledge and who can't? This is a weird double standard, yet there are many traffic reaction channels and car-vloggers, moto-vloggers who show number plates.
Are they all sueable?
Would really love you, or anybody, to clarify what's allowed and what isn't. I know I'm asking for a lot, but since you are showing with this video that you generally are willing to put in the work.

In the past I have used an original song in the background of a video, that song was published by the original author under a Creative Commons licence. Many years later the video got claimed by some record label. I can only assume the artist had signed a deal with them. I responded with a copy of the licence that I held, as well as a hyperlink to where that media was still being distributed by the artist under that Creative Commons licence. However, I got an automated response threatening legal action. 

As mentioned in this video, I had no recourse because they have lawyers and I don't. I had a valid licence, and was able to prove it. Yet there was nothing I could do about it due to what I will assume was a lack of competence at said label. I would guess that the labels threats of suing were probably empty, since their main business proposition to artists was YouTube takedowns.

When an artist who owned their own music got copyright claimed by a company which owned a video in which his music was played in the background for a few seconds... even though the original music video was published well before.

A large creator with no violations in their new video got copyright claimed by a small account with no videos. YT gave the money earned through add revenue to the small account and even after correcting the false claim the small account got to keep the money and had no strikes against their channel.


YT is so geared against creators that even when you have all the legal rights it still screws you over and gives money to anyone making a claim. If the claimer is in the wrong no penalties.

It's impossible to say how significant these problems due to how big Youtube is and the massive shadow number that never gets any attention, but from what we have seen, this looks very bad for individual affected content creators to me.

"Unpopular opinion: copyright should last 5 years, and require renewing every 5 years up up a limit of 20 years.

Further I think when a creation becomes part of the public consciousness it should get some special legal status (details of which I have no clue about).

Then there are phenomena, such as Star Trek, that maybe could use a separate set of rules. For instance, I would be happy to see Star Trek get appropriated from its owners and controlled by a fan-run organisation.

How, and if, these changes should be made are moot points because these opinions are unpopular with the people who has money and power.
